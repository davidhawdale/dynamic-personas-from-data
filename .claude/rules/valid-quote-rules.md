# Valid Quote Rules

A valid quote is exact verbatim words from the transcript; no paraphrasing; if you omit words from the middle of a quote, replace them with `...`

A quote may start or end at any point in a sentence — no leading or trailing `...` is required. Use `...` only to mark words omitted from the middle of a quote.

Here are some examples of valid quotes:

### Sentence start — quote begins at the start of the sentence

* **Transcript**: i don't use any today, so at least on the email sequence automation part, i don't have tools that allow me to do that. hence the interest in perhaps being helped by ai on this part.
* **Quote**: I don't use any today, so at least on the email sequence automation part, I don't have tools that allow me to do that.

### Mid-sentence start — quote begins partway through a sentence (no leading `...` needed)

* **Transcript**: so, for personal tasks, i really try to limit my use of ai, because for ecological reasons, i really want to restrict it to professional tasks. even at a professional level, i always try to think if i can do it another way. so, for personal tasks, my use is very, very limited, if not nonexistent.
* **Quote**: for ecological reasons, I really want to restrict it to professional tasks

### Ellipsis omission — words skipped in the middle are replaced with `...`

* **Transcript**: sure. so i pulled down data from banking and investment sites, csvs, and threw that into excel. then i use ai to streamline the process of analyzing that data, such as aggregates, projections, and pivot tables. ai serves as a shortcut to remembering how to do things in excel with the data. i just tell the ai what my end goal is and let it figure out the menus and icons needed to get there.
* **Quote**: I use AI to streamline the process of analyzing that data ... AI serves as a shortcut to remembering how to do things in Excel with the data. I just tell the AI what my end goal is and let it figure out the menus and icons needed to get there.
