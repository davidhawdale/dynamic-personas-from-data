# Valid Quote Rules

A valid quote is exact verbatim words from the transcript; no paraphrasing; if you omit words from the middle of a quote, replace them with `...`

A quote may start or end at any point in a sentence — no leading or trailing `...` is required. Use `...` only to mark words omitted from the middle of a quote.

Here are some examples of valid quotes:

### Sentence start — quote begins at the start of the sentence

* **Transcript**: i don't use any today, so at least on the email sequence automation part, i don't have tools that allow me to do that. hence the interest in perhaps being helped by ai on this part.
* **Quote**: I don't use any today, so at least on the email sequence automation part, I don't have tools that allow me to do that.

### Mid-sentence start — quote begins partway through a sentence (no leading `...` needed)

* **Transcript**: so, for personal tasks, i really try to limit my use of ai, because for ecological reasons, i really want to restrict it to professional tasks. even at a professional level, i always try to think if i can do it another way. so, for personal tasks, my use is very, very limited, if not nonexistent.
* **Quote**: for ecological reasons, I really want to restrict it to professional tasks

### Ellipsis omission — words skipped in the middle are replaced with `...`

* **Transcript**: sure. so i pulled down data from banking and investment sites, csvs, and threw that into excel. then i use ai to streamline the process of analyzing that data, such as aggregates, projections, and pivot tables. ai serves as a shortcut to remembering how to do things in excel with the data. i just tell the ai what my end goal is and let it figure out the menus and icons needed to get there.
* **Quote**: I use AI to streamline the process of analyzing that data ... AI serves as a shortcut to remembering how to do things in Excel with the data. I just tell the AI what my end goal is and let it figure out the menus and icons needed to get there.

## Common mistakes that invalidate a quote

These look plausible but fail verbatim validation:

**Dropping words from the sentence start**
* **Transcript**: Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code.
* ❌ **Invalid**: I use AI for generating code and fixing problems in my code. *(dropped "Another thing ... is")*
* ✅ **Valid**: Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code. *(full verbatim)* — or start later in the sentence at a genuine verbatim point, e.g. "generating code and fixing problems in my code"

**Dropping a filler word**
* **Transcript**: I also find it fascinating to work with an AI assistant that is incredibly good at some things
* ❌ **Invalid**: I find it fascinating to work with an AI assistant that is incredibly good at some things *(dropped "also")*
* ✅ **Valid**: I also find it fascinating to work with an AI assistant that is incredibly good at some things — or start mid-sentence: "fascinating to work with an AI assistant..."

**Stripping inner punctuation**
* **Transcript**: use Tilt prompts: "Find me a restaurant near the beach"
* ❌ **Invalid**: use Tilt prompts: Find me a restaurant near the beach *(stripped the inner quotation marks)*
* ✅ **Valid**: use Tilt prompts: "Find me a restaurant near the beach" *(preserve all punctuation as-is)*

**Self-check rule:** Before finalising each quote, ask: *"Can I find this exact string (case-insensitive) as a substring of the transcript?"* If not, the quote is invalid — find the actual verbatim text.
