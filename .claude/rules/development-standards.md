## Check for Tools First

Before writing a script, check the workflow folder and `02-workflows/shared/` first. Only create new scripts if none exist.

## Update Workflows as You Learn

Workflow orchestration files are living documents. When you discover API constraints, better approaches, common errors, or timing expectations — update the Learnings section. But don't create or overwrite workflows without asking.
