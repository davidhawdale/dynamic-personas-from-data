# Contradiction Rules

## Direct Contradictions

* Same topic, different sentiments at different points in the interview.
* Example: "I love the sleep content" versus "I barely use the sleep features anymore."

## Loyalty versus behavior gaps

* Stated commitment doesn't match revealed actions.
* Example: "I'd never cancel" and "I looked at competitor websites last week."

## Confidence erosion

* Strong statement followed by hedging or walking back.
* Example: "Totally worth it, definitely, I mean, I think so, for now anyway."

## Rationalisation signals

* Unprompted justification. Convincing themselves, not describing.
* Defensive framing of price or value.
* "It's worth it" or "it's fine" said multiple times.
* Emphatic loyalty that feels performative.

## Not a contradiction

* Different opinions on different features
* Nuanced views: "I love X but I wish it had Y"
* Changed circumstances explained in context
