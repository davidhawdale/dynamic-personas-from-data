# Persona Diversity Guidance

Ensure variety across the persona set in:

- Age ranges (spread across 25-60+ where appropriate)
- Genders
- Personality types (mix of confident/cautious, tech-savvy/tech-reluctant, etc.)
- Pain point severity (some satisfied users, some frustrated, some mixed)
- Attitude toward the product/platform (advocates, critics, and neutral users)
