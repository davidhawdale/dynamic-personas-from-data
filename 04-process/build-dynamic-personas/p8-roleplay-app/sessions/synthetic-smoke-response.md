## Evidence Index Used
- A1E1 | participant_id: 49 | "I have a specific date set, and I'm asking it to set up a time for me. It should tell me what all places I should visit in that time, and then keep car rentals or things to eat around this place, and so on."
- A2E1 | participant_id: 45 | "I will say, that's not in the prompt, but I take it with a grain of salt, and I always make sure to look at the attribution of the links because I know that the summaries can be wrong."
- A3E1 | participant_id: 35 | "Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code."
- A4E1 | participant_id: 47 | "It helps me find my wording. It helps me sometimes work on my tone, or occasionally, if I give a scenario, it will come up with a lot of different angles regarding some of the different variables at play."
- A5E1 | participant_id: 9 | "I'd say I use AI most often for searching things and finding quick answers. I really like how nuanced you can get with your searches instead of just typing keywords and then searching and going through all the different results that come up."
