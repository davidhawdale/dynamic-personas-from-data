# Participant Archetypes

## Archetype 1: Workflow Optimisers

Pattern: These participants primarily use AI to reduce operational overhead across email, scheduling, coordination, and data-heavy routines. They value assistants that connect systems, keep commitments visible, and convert fragmented admin work into actionable daily plans.

Differentiators:

- They emphasize orchestration across tools (email, calendar, data sources) over one-off brainstorming.
- Their success criterion is practical execution speed with fewer manual handoffs.

Participants: {10, 11, 20, 21, 28, 29, 33, 36, 49, 50, FR36, PL21, 13}

Evidence Quotes:

> "I have a specific date set, and I'm asking it to set up a time for me. It should tell me what all places I should visit in that time, and then keep car rentals or things to eat around this place, and so on."
> — Participant 49

> "For me, the perfect AI assistant would be able to tap into my emails and have access to my calendar. So if I were to say, "What do I have planned for today? How do I need to prepare for my day? Is there something that I said I would do that I haven't yet achieved?" I would love for the AI assistant to help keep me on task."
> — Participant 28

> "what would interest me is that it's directly connected, at least in my professional case, directly to our data and brings more precision. Because right now, it's me who gives it a lot of context with variables, and it isn't capable, at least for us, of retrieving those variables and therefore doing an analysis, for example."
> — Participant FR36

## Archetype 2: Guarded Verifiers

Pattern: These participants engage with AI, but through a strong risk filter around factual reliability, verification burden, and downstream consequences of wrong answers. They are not anti-AI, but they actively check claims and set tighter boundaries on trust.

Differentiators:

- They normalize verification as part of usage rather than assuming output correctness.
- Their adoption is shaped by risk-control habits, including privacy and environmental caution.

Participants: {1, 2, 6, 7, 14, 17, 18, 39, 45, 48, 51, DE7, PL17}

Evidence Quotes:

> "I will say, that's not in the prompt, but I take it with a grain of salt, and I always make sure to look at the attribution of the links because I know that the summaries can be wrong."
> — Participant 45

> "I know that AI is constantly learning and you have to use it wisely because not all information is verified."
> — Participant 17

> "for personal tasks, I really try to limit my use of AI, because for ecological reasons, I really want to restrict it to professional tasks. Even at a professional level, I always try to think if I can do it another way. So, for personal tasks, my use is very, very limited, if not nonexistent."
> — Participant 1

## Archetype 3: Creative Builders

Pattern: These participants use AI as a making partner across design, content, coding, and practical home projects. They value acceleration and ideation but also recognize where generated outputs need correction, domain nuance, or manual refinement.

Differentiators:

- They use AI in production workflows (not just exploratory Q&A).
- They tolerate iterative refinement when AI helps them ship faster or explore more options.

Participants: {5, 12, 16, 23, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 42, 44, 46, ES5, FR37, PL13}

Evidence Quotes:

> "Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code."
> — Participant 35

> "I like to use AI to assess some of the images that I upload as a form of DIY. I take pictures of a broken wall or a broken wall socket, anything that I don't know how to manage myself, and then I get AI to analyze it. It tells me how much paint I need to buy and where I can purchase whatever tools I need for the do-it-yourself home project."
> — Participant 16

> "I asked for a pattern and I thought it was going to write a very detailed pattern with what you had to do row by row, etc., but it couldn't do that."
> — Participant ES5

## Archetype 4: Relational Co-Pilots

Pattern: These participants treat AI as a conversational partner for social framing, tone calibration, and reflective thinking, while remaining aware of interpersonal limits versus human dialogue. They value context-aware interaction that supports communication and emotional clarity.

Differentiators:

- They frequently use AI to prepare or improve human-to-human interactions.
- They weigh conversational utility against perceived loss of human reciprocity.

Participants: {3, 22, 25, 38, 40, 43, 47, FR1}

Evidence Quotes:

> "It helps me find my wording. It helps me sometimes work on my tone, or occasionally, if I give a scenario, it will come up with a lot of different angles regarding some of the different variables at play."
> — Participant 47

> "I think a perfect AI assistant would be able to keep track of my various projects so that I can quickly say, "Please send an email to so-and-so about this detail." It would know which project I'm referring to and the person I'm talking about."
> — Participant 43

> "It's actually become a fairly nice companion. I'm quite happy to do what Tyler Cohen suggests, which is to put a lot of myself out there so that the AIs can engage with me."
> — Participant 22

## Archetype 5: Adaptive Strategists

Pattern: These participants use AI as an adaptive thinking engine for broad life management: searching, learning, planning, and dynamic reprioritization. They want nuanced assistance that evolves with changing context rather than fixed single-task outputs.

Differentiators:

- They emphasize breadth and adaptability over narrow specialized features.
- Their ideal assistant is an ongoing strategic aid for decision flow, not just task completion.

Participants: {8, 9, 19, 30}

Evidence Quotes:

> "I'd say I use AI most often for searching things and finding quick answers. I really like how nuanced you can get with your searches instead of just typing keywords and then searching and going through all the different results that come up."
> — Participant 9

> "I use AI as my new Google search. For anything that comes to mind, whether it's an event or not, or news, I will ask ChatGPT because I can have a conversation or learn more."
> — Participant 19

> "One of the main daily uses of AI that I hope will occur sooner rather than later is a more nuanced task listing tool."
> — Participant 30
