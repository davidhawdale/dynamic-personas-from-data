## Calendar And Scheduling

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Calendar Based Predictive Notifications
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 52-52

> Well, that would obviously allow me to, if AI could be connected to my calendar, it could say, on this date, you are bound to probably run out of X, Y, Z. That could prompt me to open a shopping app that maybe already has the shopping basket kind of prepopulated, or it could notify me that I need to buy electricity, etcetera, etcetera.

## Coding And Technical Support

- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 39-39

> I would do all the measurements in a room. I would measure the windows, the walls, the height, and the length, and I would input it exactly as it is. I would then ask AI to give me a 3D model to scale of all those measurements, but for some reason, it didn't matter how perfect I was with inputting the measurements; it could not give me a 3D model.

- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative

- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: Medium

- Transcript lines: 25-25

- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 62-62

> I felt a little bit more relaxed because I didn't feel like I needed to worry about my presentation or whether or not I brushed or combed my hair or had makeup on. I suppose I don't feel like there's a human judgmental aspect behind this type of interview style, which makes it easier to show up.

### Quote 2

- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 39-39

> If it could calculate the amount of paint that I need, what it would cost me, the building expenses, and everything with it while visualizing it or showing me a visual representation, I think that would be great as a personal assistant. I would be able to save a lot of money and time with that.

- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 39-39

## Home And DIY Support

- Original tag: DIY Image Assessment
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> I like to use AI to assess some of the images that I upload as a form of DIY. I take pictures of a broken wall or a broken wall socket, anything that I don't know how to manage myself, and then I get AI to analyze it. It tells me how much paint I need to buy and where I can purchase whatever tools I need for the do-it-yourself home project.

## Human Connection And Rapport

### Quote 1

- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Medium

- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 20-20

- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 43-43

> I think a perfect AI assistant could also help me know when certain ingredients or products in my kitchen are running out. It could help me keep track of my electricity usage and give me notifications for when I need to buy certain items, like when I need to purchase new electricity, when the milk is going to go sour, or when my eggs are running low.

### Quote 3
- Original tag: Smart Fridge Integration Interest
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 47-47

> It would be amazing if I had a fridge that was smart enough to tell me when my milk is about to go sour; that would be great. However, it would obviously also need to be linked to my smartphone so that I can control the notifications and possibly take it with me to the shops if I do the shopping or if I do delivery shopping purchases.

## Trust And Verification

- Transcript lines: 30-30

## Usage And Adoption Patterns

### Quote 1
- Original tag: No Pressure To Impress AI
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 66-66

> Yeah, I definitely think it affects how open or detailed I am in my responses. I suppose when you deal with humans, there's that human aspect where you almost don't want to let the interviewer down. You sometimes say things that you think the interviewer maybe wants to hear instead of actually expressing what you really think. I think it's a very human approach, a very human thing to try to either impress or make the interviewer happy.
