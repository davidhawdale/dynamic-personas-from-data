Or, you know, if I saw a draft of something and it was pretty good, I'd be like, yeah. Send it. Go.

Anything I need to know, do, think about ahead of time? Oh, you have a, I'll use again the blood draw. You need to fast. No more eating after 8 PM tonight. Okay? Great.

- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 106-106

- Original tag: Ecosystem Integration Roadmap
- Question ref: Q10
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 82-82

Here's how you use it with your already approved tools, like all the tools you're already using today, and it'll help you do this.

- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 33-33

- Question ref: Q9b
- Severity: Medium

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Monologue Effect
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 102-102

> The conversation feels one-directional. I'm recording this, but I feel like I'm mostly talking to myself, which is obviously different from talking to another human or even a more personified AI—something that has a bit more personality, voice, or texture that could make the interaction feel more identifiable.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: One-Sided Perception
- Question ref: Q11b
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 106-106

> I'll leave that to my design friends and ask them what would relate back to the idea that the conversation doesn't feel so one-sided.

Like, I look at my calendar on Sundays, I look at my work week calendar and kind of parse out, and I have to reconcile. By the way, I have a work calendar and a personal calendar, so reconciling my work and personal calendar would be interesting to me too.

## Memory And Context Continuity

- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 53-53

- Question ref: Q9c
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 71-71

> It could be that it's like it can help me with certain things, and then it stops at others. So it's one thing to schedule appointments.

- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 114-114

> Is there another way, particularly if it's like, "Hey, this recording should have been more like fifty seconds, and you've gone on for a minute and a half"? Is there something that could happen in this engagement or interaction that would indicate, like, maybe we have four more questions? Let's move on.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Reverse Calendly Vision
- Question ref: Q9a
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 59-59

> I would really love for an AI to say, "Hey, I see you have tabs open searching for this type of doctor or this type of exam you need or this type of referral that your doctor has sent you. Is that something I could help you get scheduled? Can I act on your behalf and find a time? This time looks open on their calendar; can we book that for you?" That would be really cool. It's almost like how I imagine Calendly, but in reverse, looking across different platforms, agnostic of how those all get hooked up together.

## Privacy And Security

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Data Privacy Non-Negotiable
- Question ref: Q9c
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 71-71

> Yeah. I think this is the key issue for me, is in order to let AI do some of this stuff is, like, I need to know that I can manage and trust settings around AI information and privacy concerns, like the privacy, information. I need to know that if I were to and I would pay for that. If I had this AI assistant that I'm describing, is that especially if I'm paying for that service, you're not the the company that owned that's created that isn't selling my data all over the place.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Privacy Skepticism
- Question ref: Q9c
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 71-71

## Proactive Assistance

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Proactive Anticipation Need
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 53-53

> So I think about how I leave those all open because if I close them, then I lose track of what was I working on, what did I need to respond to or do something with. And so, like, a real personal assistant, wouldn't it be awesome if I could have an AI that, you know, would remind me or notify me or schedule things for me or start something for me like, hey. I see you need to respond to this person or you need to apply for this thing or you need to reach out to this, provider or whatever and how to actually act as a personal assistant in that way.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Reactive Versus Proactive Pattern
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 53-53

> So something that's more anticipatory and proactive than just the reactive way that I probably use it right now, which is in response to certain prompts that I give it, and right now, mostly for information rather than taking action on my behalf.

### Quote 3
- Original tag: Initiative Fatigue
- Question ref: Q9b
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 67-67

## Search And Research

### Quote 1
- Original tag: AI-Powered Search Integration
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 20-20

- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 102-102

> I'm also very aware of how long I'm talking for, whereas when you're talking to other people, you get social cues back, like, "That's great, let's move on." Right now, it feels like I could just talk forever, and you wouldn't stop me. That piece is missing—the social cues that help keep the conversation moving or indicate that a response is good and we can move forward.

## System Fragmentation And Interoperability

### Quote 1
- Original tag: System Fragmentation Pain
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 53-53

- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 102-102

> I mean, I think it's been fine. I'm aware that there's no voice and no actual engagement. You've been very good at reflecting back to me what I've said and pivoting around the use cases or scenarios I've given you, which I find interesting and positive. I appreciate that. The downside is that it doesn't feel superhuman; it feels like a very fancy survey, which may be okay for some use cases, but it doesn't feel like an interview per se.

- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 71-71

- Transcript lines: 53-53

- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 80-80

I think if you were built into specific systems like this, it might look different than if you had different tools for all of these different applications. But as a Google user, I'm already using email, calendars, Google Drive. I am pretty bought into notifications, like texts. I'm pretty bought into the Google ecosystem.

- Question ref: Q9c
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 71-71

- Question ref: Q11c
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 110-110

> One of the things that I thought was fairly effective was when the AI was engaging with me. It actually had a voice, like a Siri-type voice, that would talk to me with the questions rather than just a text-based version. It had this kind of visual layer that looked like it was representing the sound of my voice, with the ups and downs and what have you. When I would respond, it had an element that was not talking but reflected something very subtle about it listening, which was a good cue of a conversation.
