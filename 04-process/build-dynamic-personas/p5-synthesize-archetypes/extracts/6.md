## Accuracy And Hallucination Risk

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Accuracy Primary Requirement
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 49-49

> accurate information will always be the most important factor ... the most difficult aspect of AI assistance right now is that they are not accurate, and there's also no way to know which parts are not accurate, especially if you're not an expert in the field that we're discussing.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Source Mismatch Frustration
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 53-53

> if I'm asking for a tutorial on how to use a relatively new tool in Figma, it might give me an answer that sounds like it's about that tool. However, when I check the source, it's actually a tutorial for a similar but different tool. I then have to spend time reading through that to realize, oh, this is not accurate; it's just assuming that this one tool can be used the same way as the other one.

## Content And Writing Support

### Quote 1

- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 24-24

> looking at recommendations online is very difficult because there's a lot of paid sponsorship that is disguised as articles. It's hard to know for sure if something was not sponsored to give a good review versus a genuine review.

## Creative Design And Media

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Creative Vision Gap
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 33-33

> it's very difficult to get the image that you actually have in your head for the judge for any AI to reproduce. That is actually very hard.

- Sentiment: mixed
- Transcript lines: 62-62

- Original tag: Cross-Conversation Memory Gap
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 57-57

> it would be better if the AI had a stronger memory of the conversations it has with users. Within a single chat, it remembers the conversation quite well, but it still misses some parts or gets confused. It doesn't really transfer information from other conversations effectively.

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Generic Follow-Up Feeling
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 76-76

## Prompting And Instruction Quality

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Prompt Labor Cost
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 29-29

> The level of specificity I needed to provide was more work for me than if I just did the animations myself. The amount of labor it would have taken to work through the AI to get it to function and produce what I wanted was just too much.

## Search And Research

- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> ChatGPT is likely to give me an answer that's at least 80% accurate, compared to Googling, which results in a bunch of website links that I then have to sift through to find the answer. So, it's quicker if I just ask.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Cross-Reference Desired
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: mixed
- Transcript lines: 57-57

> It would be helpful if it could remember when I talked about something in another chat and cross-reference those discussions. I believe that would enhance the experience significantly.

## Social And Relationship Communication

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Iterative Narrowing Dialogue
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 20-20

> I do a sequence of conversations, so I don't just ask one question and then get the answer. I normally start with a question that gives a general idea of what's happening, and then I receive an answer. After that, I narrow it down further, and it provides me with another answer, which I narrow down even more.

### Quote 3
- Original tag: Nuance Complexity Barrier
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 35-35

> you have to create a prompt that indicates and defines all those nuances in a syntax that's understandable by the AI so that it can at least provide you with a result that's within the ballpark of what you want. The more nuances there are, the more likely it is that you'll miss it, either because it's just not intelligent enough or your prompt was not good enough.

### Quote 4
- Original tag: AI As Shortcuts Only
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 62-62

> how I see AI being integrated into tools is more like shortcuts. It can add shortcuts to things, but it can't really provide full-fledged functionality, basically.
