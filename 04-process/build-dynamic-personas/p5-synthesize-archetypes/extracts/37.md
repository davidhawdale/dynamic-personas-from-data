> I use AI to find cooking recipes with what I have in my fridge, to help me write emails when I need a particular tone or phrasing that I can't find. I sometimes have a bit of trouble finding, and it also helps me find itineraries, restaurants, or places of interest when I go on vacation.

> The size limitation was no longer the main problem. So, the problem was just that it created lists with a lot of duplicates. For example, we had Mathilde twice in the same team, or Mathilde was in three different teams, so it was impossible. I still had to go back and redo it 100% myself, because in fact, it was too long to ensure that each team was correct. It was faster to do it myself and start from scratch.

> I don't know, overall I feel like the questions might be a bit redundant compared to the first questions, we are unable to ask it to clarify certain things. So, I don't know if, for example, I completely forgot to say that AI could also help me manage all my emails, in scheduling appointments with the bank ... I find that it's a bit more structured, but not necessarily in a good way, as it prevents spontaneity on our side and exploring certain answers that could be interesting for humans.

## Proactive Assistance

> A concrete example would be that I notice there is no more butter in the fridge, and I therefore add butter to my shopping list. The productivity would be that, via my drive application, it directly adds the butter to my cart, knowing that it's the butter I usually buy, since it knows it. It's the same principle for medical appointments. For example, analyzing the fact that I go to the hairdresser every six weeks and reminding me to make an appointment a few weeks before, automatically recording appointments in my calendar and having reminders the day before, for example an hour before.

> For me, a perfect personal assistant would be one that helps me in my personal life to manage my mental load, especially by allowing me to save time, for example, for shopping or planning appointments with the doctor or the vet. It would automatically record my alerts in my calendar, with reminders at the right time to remind me what I need to do. In fact, overall, it's someone who would take initiatives, more than an assistant who would wait for me to tell it to do things.

### Quote 2

That's what I like and want to eat, so it can suggest recipes based on those tastes and add all the ingredients directly to my Drive to save me time and lighten my mental load.

> I had to define random teams and had provided a list of names and surnames with the team in which the people were. I asked it to make teams where there was at least one specific person in each team ... I told it to make teams of six with at least three people from the product team and three people from the tech team. I couldn't succeed because the file was too big, there were two hundred and fifty names, and it told me that the file was too big and that with the free version, I couldn't do what I wanted. So, I had to do it manually.
