- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 70-70

> This experience felt kind of two-dimensional, a little bit flat. The AI was responsive to what I was saying, which I appreciate—that's cool—but not responsive in the way that a human being would be, with their facial expressions, tone of voice, and being a fully realized human being.

- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 70-70

- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 47-47

- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 29-29

> A time that I wanted to use AI for something but couldn't was when I was working with really private or identifiable data. For instance, I wanted to use AI in my research. One of the research tools I like to use is Max QDA for qualitative data analysis ... I can't de-identify qualitative data, like interview transcripts, which makes it really difficult. So, I haven't used it for that purpose yet because I want to explore more about responsible use in that case.

## Recipes And Cooking Support

- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 20-20

> AI is really useful for when I have disparate ingredients that don't naturally go together, coming up with ways to combine them and add other ingredients into the mix to create a recipe that makes sense.
