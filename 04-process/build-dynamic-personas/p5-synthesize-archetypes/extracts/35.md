## AI Interview Experience

### Quote 1
- Original tag: AI Interview Similarity
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Low
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 70-70

> This feels quite similar to answering a survey but doing it with video. I noticed that the AI asked follow-up questions based on what I said, which I think is pretty cool, but it feels quite similar to answering a static survey.

## Automation And Delegation

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Autonomous Admin Task Delegation
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 47-47

> It would be great if AI could autonomously handle administrative tasks that I don't want to do. For example, paying invoices, rescheduling doctor's appointments, interpreting results from the doctor, and understanding if the contract my landlord sent me is fair and if I could negotiate on it.

## Coding And Technical Support

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Code Generation And Problem Solving
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Iterative Code Assistance
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 24-24

> In the past, I used AI to completely generate code from scratch in languages that I was not familiar with, but I stopped doing that because I realized I couldn't extend the app. AI tends to produce quite a lot of extra code, and it's not always efficient. So these days, I use AI to help me when I have the skeleton of an idea and I have enough knowledge to make the application myself.

## Creative Design And Media

### Quote 1
- Original tag: AI Design Limitations
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 29-29

> I've used AI to generate designs for me as a product designer. I provide the requirements, and it generates mock-ups for me. I found that while it can create visually appealing mock-ups, it tends to put me in a box. It often just copies the UI of other websites and doesn't deeply understand the problems I'm trying to solve.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Creative Inhibition Effect
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 29-29

> Additionally, having seen ideas from the AI, it hinders my ability to think creatively because I tend to iterate off the ideas that the AI generated.

### Quote 3
- Original tag: Creative Time Reallocation
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 47-47

> Basically, I would like it to proactively manage the admin tasks that I would do myself, freeing up my time to focus on more creative work.

## Privacy And Security

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Privacy Data Access Resistance
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 60-60

> Realistically, I probably would not give the AI that much access to my personal data because I would be concerned about the privacy implications of that.

## Proactive Assistance

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Follow-Up Value Acknowledgment
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Low
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 74-74

> If I think about being on the other side, I can imagine it's quite helpful for the AI to ask follow-up questions rather than it just being a static survey.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Proactive Event Coordination
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 55-55

> For example, booking trips, finding the best flights, and coordinating dates with the people I'm traveling with. Another example is that I have a friend in town this week, and he wants to go out next weekend. I know the kind of things he would like, but I'm going to manually search for what events are on. If it could proactively give me some options for events, that would be helpful—things like this.

## Time And Productivity

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Efficiency Without Understanding Loss
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 24-24

> I'm just speeding up some processes by getting it to generate code, while making sure that I understand the code and also helping me make the code more efficient.

## Travel Planning

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Multi-Parameter Trip Planning
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> I use AI for similar kinds of tasks that I would use Google for, but with more complicated queries. For example, when I'm planning a trip that's three days long in a specific location and I have dietary requirements and specific interests, I can pass all of those parameters to the AI, and it can create an itinerary for me.

## Usage And Adoption Patterns

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Personal Survey Experience
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Low
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 74-74

> However, my experience as a person answering these questions feels quite similar to a static survey.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Narrow Solution Framing
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 33-33

> I think it gives me a solution, and I tend to think more narrowly based on its solution rather than thinking broadly and coming up with a bunch of ideas on my own.

### Quote 3
- Original tag: Legal Contract Assessment
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 51-51

> As an example, I'm negotiating a German rental contract at the moment, and I'm not sure the clauses in the contract are entirely fair. Instead of Googling or using AI for hours to try to figure it out, I would like the AI to tell me if the contract is fair.

### Quote 4
- Original tag: AI Reliability Concern
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 60-60

> However, at the moment, I would not allow the AI to autonomously do things because it still makes mistakes.

### Quote 5
- Original tag: System Interconnection Requirement
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 60-60

> I think it would need to be connected to those apps in order to autonomously do things on my behalf.
