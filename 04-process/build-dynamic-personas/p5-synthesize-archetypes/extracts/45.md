## Accuracy And Hallucination Risk

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Research Verification Pattern
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> It's not a foolproof thing; it's usually like getting started with a summary and then continuing my own research to verify if what's in the summary is true or if there are other angles.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Verification Through Attribution Check
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> I will say, that's not in the prompt, but I take it with a grain of salt, and I always make sure to look at the attribution of the links because I know that the summaries can be wrong.

## Cognitive Support Patterns

### Quote 1
- Original tag: ChatGPT For Complex Task Analysis
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 18-18

> I also sometimes use ChatGPT if I have a slightly more complicated task that I need to do where the search query would be too narrow or I actually need it to perform some analysis for me.

## Current Tool Sufficiency

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Current Tools Adequate
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 49-49

> Honestly, the AI tools that I use right now feel pretty adequate for what I need them to be. Maybe it's because I kind of know what I should be using them for and what they're not good for, and I kind of self-limit.

## Personalization And Adaptation

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Confidence Level Transparency Need
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 49-49

> I think the number one thing is, does the AI have an awareness of its own level of credibility or trust? Can it give you a rating that's like, I am X percent confident that the results I'm giving you today are accurate, or this is from 10 sources versus five sources?

## Privacy And Security

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Informed Consent For AI Interviews
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 76-76

> Just take the informed consent model that researchers have and apply it to an AI. Tell me how my data is going to be used, how it's going to be stored, what recourse I have for getting it deleted, or for stopping the interview at any time and having that information scrubbed.

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Privacy Concern About Personal Disclosure
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 72-72

> I didn't sign any privacy agreement with this thing. I don't know where the data goes. I mean, does the whole internet know that I'm pregnant now or that I'm thinking about breastfeeding? Probably not. In fact, surely not, but it just feels different than having someone in front of you who can reassure you that your information is private and confidential, and who you know has been trained to think about those things that way, ideally.

## Prompting And Instruction Quality

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Vague Requirements Caused Failure
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 31-31

> I asked it to do some computation, and I wasn't being specific enough about what I wanted. Then I just ran out of free credits, and I didn't want to pay for it.

## Search And Research

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Search Synthesis Primary Need
- Question ref: Q4
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 16-16

> I think most of my personal tasks for AI are honestly the Google summary that happens at the top of the search right now. Because I don't know, I'm a pretty curious person, so I'm constantly googling things. The ability to synthesize information is probably the number one thing that search takes care of and that I need.

## Task Organization And Prioritization

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Admin And Task Prioritization Need
- Question ref: Q9
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: positive
- Transcript lines: 62-62

> The biggest thing I can think of is just the admin that my husband and I have to do to manage our social life and also our tasks that we need to get done throughout the week. If there was a way, I don't know how this would work, but something that could help me see what's coming up, anticipate what's ahead, and also rank order what's most important to tackle now.

## Tool Reliability And Limitations

### Quote 1
- Original tag: Scope Clarity Uncertainty
- Question ref: Q11
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 72-72

> The other issue was that you started off by asking me very specifically about my personal AI experiences, and then we got a little vaguer as we went on. I wasn't sure if we were still talking about personal stuff or if you wanted me to start talking about work stuff, or if it was okay for me to start talking about work stuff.

## Trust And Verification

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Categorical Confidence Preference
- Question ref: Q8
- Severity: High
- Sentiment: neutral
- Transcript lines: 53-53

> I think I actually want something that's more like a human scale or more categorical, or that gives me a better sense of my next step. So it's like, I'm pretty confident this is right, but you probably want to check a few things, or like, I'm not very confident this is right. You should enter this query in a bunch more times, or like, I'm very confident this is right, and here's why.

## Usage And Adoption Patterns

### Quote 2
- Original tag: Data Aggregation Mismatch
- Question ref: Q5
- Severity: Medium
- Sentiment: negative
- Transcript lines: 35-35

> I think it was something like I fed it a spreadsheet and asked it to calculate some things in a particular way, or aggregate the data in a specific way, but it didn't end up doing it the way I needed it to.
