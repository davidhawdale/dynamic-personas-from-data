The key to utilizing AI well lies in how you prompt it, the amount of information you provide, and the level of detail you include so that it can deliver better information ... a perfect AI would assist the user with those prompts by saying, "Okay, this is what you have, and these are the things you've missed.

> I think also suggesting tangibles in the way that I use AI or creating some kind of plan around things would be helpful. For example, if we had diagnosed my tree in the garden, it could provide specific actions to take, like what you should do, what you need to do, and the timelines for each task.
