PL13,en_translated_from_pl_participant_0013,Q4,Learning Through Curiosity,High,positive,"Very often I ask AI about curiosities regarding the world or various topics I don't yet know the answers to. AI explains all topics very well and in detail, and it also talks about various things, so it's a very interesting tool for everyday use, of course with caution.",20,20
PL13,en_translated_from_pl_participant_0013,Q4,AI Impartiality Appreciation,Medium,positive,"For example, I asked who would win the presidential election, and AI was very diplomatic, not pointing to any candidate. I really liked that it was so impartial.",24,24

PL13,en_translated_from_pl_participant_0013,Q8,Physical Activity Motivation,High,positive,"I think it should remind everyone that physical activity is necessary to maintain a balance between work and daily life, because staying cooped up at home can only have a negative impact on a person, on their behavior, habits and discouragement from life.",51,51

PL13,en_translated_from_pl_participant_0013,Q11,Preference For Direct Communication,Medium,negative,They can't say directly what's on their heart. They prefer to gossip rather than just be human.,74,74
