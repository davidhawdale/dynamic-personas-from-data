FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q5,File Size Limitation Frustration,High,negative,"I couldn't do it because the file was too big, there were two hundred and fifty names, and it told me the file was too large and that with the free version I couldn't do what I wanted. So I had to do it manually.",29,29
FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q5,AI Duplicate Error Problem,High,negative,"The size limitation was no longer the main issue.

FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q8,Proactivity Over Passivity,High,positive,"it's someone who would take initiative, more than an assistant who would wait for me to tell it to do things.

FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q8,Contextual Shopping Integration,Medium,positive,"I notice there's no butter left in the fridge, and I therefore add butter to my shopping list.

FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q11,AI Interview Scripted Limitation,High,negative,"I think AI is less spontaneous than a human. It sticks to a given script, whereas a human will bounce off my expressions, emotions and the unsaid parts of my sentence to ask even more targeted questions. AI, for its part, will stay a bit more within its script.",70,70
FR37,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0037,Q11,Question Redundancy Issue,Medium,negative,I have the impression that the questions [are] maybe a bit redundant compared to the first questions; we're unable to ask it [to] clarify certain things,74,74
