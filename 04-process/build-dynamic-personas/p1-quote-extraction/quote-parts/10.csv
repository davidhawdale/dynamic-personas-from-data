10,en_participant_0010,Q4,Travel Planning Assistance,High,positive,"I use it for top sites to see, helping me decide between different activities based on the needs of multiple people in the family group. It also helps me as a budget calculator.",20,20

10,en_participant_0010,Q5,Diagram Generation Frustration,High,negative,"I wanted to use it to help mock up the area that I had planned by just putting in points and hoping that it would draw a good diagram for me. However, it ended up being quite a lot of effort, and while it was close, it wasn't ideal.",29,29
10,en_participant_0010,Q5,Dimension Accuracy Limitations,High,negative,The dimensions just weren't close enough. It was doing some funny things because our lawn isn't a straightforward shape.,33,33

10,en_participant_0010,Q8,Email Overload Problem,High,negative,"There are just too many emails and too much information around kids' sports and school newsletters as well, so it would be great to pull out what's really useful for me.",47,47

10,en_participant_0010,Q11,Need For Human Context,High,mixed,"I felt okay about being interviewed by a person that's not a human, but I also know who the study is being run by, which probably isn't a true reflection of how I would feel if I were receiving this from nobody.
