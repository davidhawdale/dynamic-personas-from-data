23,en_participant_0023,Q4,Design Task Usage,Medium,neutral,"In my personal life, this would be more logo or tattoo ideas that I have, or just different graphics and work. It could be related to PowerPoint or creating slideshows and decks.",20,20

23,en_participant_0023,Q5,Image Generation Frustration,High,negative,"I think, especially when using the free version, the image and graphics creation can be quite limited. When you ask it to change things about the image, it can also be a bit restricted.",29,29
23,en_participant_0023,Q5,Style Adaptation Gap,High,negative,"I was trying to create an idea for a tattoo that I wanted to get, and I kept asking it to change the style of the image to replicate another style more.

23,en_participant_0023,Q8,Calendar Integration Desire,High,positive,"I think it would be great to combine an AI assistant with my calendar and my lists, similar to Siri.

23,en_participant_0023,Q8,Objective Decision Seeking,Medium,neutral,"I think sometimes I'm looking for it to look at the facts and draw an opinion based on those facts. I'm not saying it's 100% what I would believe, but if you're trying to decide on something, I'm looking for something that is unbiased and without personal impact to create and form an opinion that I can then use as I develop my own opinion.",51,51

23,en_participant_0023,Q9,Hands-Off Voice Interaction,High,positive,"I'm looking for a hands-off dictation type situation where I can think aloud.
