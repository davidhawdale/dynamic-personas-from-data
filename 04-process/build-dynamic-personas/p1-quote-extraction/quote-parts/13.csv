13,en_participant_0013,Q8,Physical Activity Support,High,positive,"I believe it should remind everyone that physical activity is necessary to maintain a balance between work and daily life, because sitting at home can only have a negative impact on a person, on their behavior, habits, and discouragement from life.",38,38
13,en_participant_0013,Q8,AI As Motivational Support,Medium,positive,"Such an assistant could at some point motivate someone to act, primarily for themselves.",38,38
13,en_participant_0013,Q8,Loneliness And Digital Disconnection,High,negative,"Many people are lonely these days because technology has unfortunately developed in such a way that it's easier for us to write a message than to meet someone face to face, live, for coffee, for a walk, for anything.",41,41
13,en_participant_0013,Q8,Nostalgia For Community Play,Medium,negative,"I think it should go back to how it used to be, when children were in the yard, everyone played together.

13,en_participant_0013,Q11,Human Dishonesty And Betrayal,High,negative,"Yes, people are false. Face to face they tell you different things, and behind your back they can stab you in the back. Unfortunately, people can't be honest. They can't say straight out what's on their mind. They prefer to gossip rather than just be people.",55,55
