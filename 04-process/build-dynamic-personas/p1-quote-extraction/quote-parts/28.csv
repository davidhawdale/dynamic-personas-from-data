28,en_participant_0028,Q4,Light Personal Use,Medium,neutral,"I normally use AI assistance to help me write emails or sometimes do a little bit of research. Not a lot of research, just light research. And that's pretty much it.",16,16
28,en_participant_0028,Q4,Business Preference,Medium,neutral,I think I use it more for business-related tasks than personal-related tasks.,16,16
28,en_participant_0028,Q4,Email Grammar Correction,High,neutral,"Occasionally, if I have an email to write, I might create a draft and then ask the AI assistant to help me correct the grammar.",20,20
28,en_participant_0028,Q4,Newsletter Content Enhancement,Medium,positive,"I would ask AI to enhance the content. For example, if there was an event we did, I would write a draft of that message and then ask AI to make it a bit more exciting while still maintaining the general feel of the monthly newsletter.",24,24
28,en_participant_0028,Q5,AI Information Gap,High,negative,"It seems they didn't have enough information, which was okay with me. So, yeah, I wasn't able to get the response I was looking for from the AI assistants because they just didn't have enough information on me.",29,29
28,en_participant_0028,Q8,Calendar Integration Desire,High,positive,"For me, the perfect AI assistant would be able to tap into my emails and have access to my calendar. So if I were to say, ""What do I have planned for today? How do I need to prepare for my day? Is there something that I said I would do that I haven't yet achieved?"" I would love for the AI assistant to help keep me on task.",43,43
28,en_participant_0028,Q8,Proactive Reminder Needs,High,positive,"And let's say there's a birthday coming up; I would like the AI assistant to say, ""Hey, your dad's birthday is coming up in a few days. Do you want me to order a gift or draft a text message or something like that?""",43,43
28,en_participant_0028,Q8,Content Discovery Preference,Medium,positive,"Or maybe if the AI assistant heard about an article that I might be interested in, it could propose that I read that article or summarize it for me. Even if there was music that my AI assistant thought I might enjoy hearing for the first time, that would be really helpful.",43,43
28,en_participant_0028,Q8,Music Recommendation Capability,Medium,positive,"I think if the AI assistant knew the type of music that I enjoyed, it would be able to make music recommendations. That would be really helpful.",47,47
28,en_participant_0028,Q9,Multi-System Integration,High,positive,"I would love it if the AI assistant could tap into or leverage my email, my music library, my calendar, and the weather. If it could make recommendations for my day, that would be really helpful.",56,56
28,en_participant_0028,Q11,AI Follow-Up Quality,High,positive,"It's actually nice to know that the AI is listening and is able to provide follow-up questions based on my previous responses. That was really refreshing. We don't always get that from a human interviewer, so that was nice.",66,66
28,en_participant_0028,Q11,Spontaneous Engagement Preference,Medium,positive,"I think a human would probably have follow-up questions in mind, but with this AI interviewer, it feels a little bit more spontaneous.",70,70
