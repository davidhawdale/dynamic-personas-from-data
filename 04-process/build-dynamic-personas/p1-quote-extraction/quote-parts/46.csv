46,en_participant_0046,Q4,Educational Design Focus,High,positive,"The most common types of personal tasks I use AI for are design work related to my job. Not design in terms of website or product design, but lesson planning. I'm a professor, so I focus on lesson planning, the design of educational activities, and so on.",16,16
46,en_participant_0046,Q4,Personal Task Variety,Medium,neutral,"Additionally, I sometimes use it in my personal life for questions or tasks that I could use help with, like, ""These are the items in my pantry; find me a recipe that I can make with these items,"" or ""Make me a spreadsheet that breaks down my credit card costs for this month. Here's the data,"" that type of thing.",16,16
46,en_participant_0046,Q4,Recipe Refinement Value,Medium,positive,"AI is really useful for when I have disparate ingredients that don't naturally go together, coming up with ways to combine them and add other ingredients into the mix to create a recipe that makes sense. I like to use AI for this because it doesn't just tell you what to combine, but also the process to follow, which is really helpful, and I can refine it as needed.",20,20
46,en_participant_0046,Q4,Financial Scenario Analysis,Medium,positive,"I was trying to estimate the cost for signing a new lease for my car, and I wanted to calculate the debt with different contract payments, with different amounts of interest over different terms of months, that type of thing. AI was helpful for running those numbers.",24,24
46,en_participant_0046,Q5,Privacy Data Blocker,High,negative,"A time that I wanted to use AI for something but couldn't was when I was working with really private or identifiable data. For instance, I wanted to use AI in my research. One of the research tools I like to use is Max QDA for qualitative data analysis ... I can't de-identify qualitative data, like interview transcripts, which makes it really difficult. So, I haven't used it for that purpose yet because I want to explore more about responsible use in that case.",29,29
46,en_participant_0046,Q6,Moderate Trust Level,Medium,neutral,3 - Moderate trust,38,38
46,en_participant_0046,Q8,Still Learning About AI,Medium,neutral,"You know, I'm still learning about AI and how to use it, as well as the different tools that exist. So, it's hard for me to answer this question about the perfect personal assistant, what things it could do, and how it would be better than existing tools.",47,47
46,en_participant_0046,Q8,Desire For Suggested Capabilities,High,positive,"one thing I can tell you is that I think it would be cool if I could use an AI that would ... More of, like, here are other things I can do. You know, not so many choices that it's overwhelming, but enough suggestions that a person can learn how to delve deeper and use AI in ways that they might not have imagined right there in the moment.",47,47
46,en_participant_0046,Q8,Learning By Example Preference,Medium,positive,"What kind of suggestions would be helpful? Maybe something like, ""Other users who wrote similar prompts asked questions like this."" Then, it could present something like, ""Here's something you could ask,"" and you could click on it.",51,51
46,en_participant_0046,Q9,Clean UX Requirement,High,neutral,"I want the user experience to be super clean and super easy to understand for a layperson, not a designer.",60,60
46,en_participant_0046,Q9,Safeguards Before Automation,High,neutral,"I would also want there to be safeguards in place before anything happens automatically, so I don't do something or send a message that's embarrassing.",60,60
46,en_participant_0046,Q11,Human Connection Irreplaceable,High,negative,"I think it would have been better for me to have been interviewed by a human because the human connection is something that can't be replicated. Human-to-human connection can't be replicated using technology, at least not right now.",70,70
46,en_participant_0046,Q11,AI Interview Experience Flatness,Medium,negative,"This experience felt kind of two-dimensional, a little bit flat. The AI was responsive to what I was saying, which I appreciate—that's cool—but not responsive in the way that a human being would be, with their facial expressions, tone of voice, and being a fully realized human being.",70,70
46,en_participant_0046,Q11,AI Appropriate For Specific Tasks,Medium,neutral,"I don't think that AI interviews ought to mimic human-to-human interaction. I think that it should probably remain as it is now, and that it should be used for tasks where that type of tool is appropriate. Humans should be involved in situations where having a human is important.",74,74
