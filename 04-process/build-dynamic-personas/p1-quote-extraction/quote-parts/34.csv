34,en_participant_0034,Q4,Garden Task Planning,High,positive,"My most common use for AI would be in the garden. What I do is use ChatGPT specifically to set up an annual flow of the tasks that I need to do in my garden. I ask what kind of work I can do in winter, what I should be doing in spring, summer, and autumn. I use it to estimate how long that work would take, set times for growth, match the plants I have with companion plants that will grow well together, and help me diagnose issues with my trees.",17,17
34,en_participant_0034,Q4,Tree Diagnosis Method,High,neutral,"The reason I use AI, or at least how I use AI to diagnose my tree issues, is that the trees I have are indigenous to South Africa, so there's not much information about them on the Internet. What I do is take pictures and describe what's happening, the situation, how the leaves look, what the leaf drop is like, and if there are any fungi or insects living on the tree.",21,21
34,en_participant_0034,Q4,Decision Framework Support,Medium,positive,"So I used AI quite often when I need to make decisions around things, when I need to weigh up certain scenarios. So I recently painted the house, and I wanted to know, you know, what's the difference between getting Plascon or Dulux, the more expensive paints versus getting Durum or Fire Earth. So AI helped me to look at the differences between them, what the benefits were, what the I mean, the pros and the cons",25,25
34,en_participant_0034,Q4,Hobby Learning Bootstrap,High,positive,"What I also do is when I'm trying to get into a hobby, say, woodworking, for example, I'll look at what are easy things to start with, what are the beginner tools that I need, what are the beginner techniques that I need. We are some you what are some YouTube channels I can go watch to learn techniques? I've done this with woodworking. I've done this with, motor mechanics working on my car as well.",25,25
34,en_participant_0034,Q4,Sports Injury Diagnosis,Medium,neutral,"I also use it when I need to well, when I have a certain sports injuries, then I will give it all the information of what I've been doing. Most of the time, it's running. So how often have I been running? What distances have I been running? The type of pain that I'm having, where it's located, what movements, trigger the pain.",25,25
34,en_participant_0034,Q5,Multimedia Content Gap,High,negative,"With electronics, there are a lot of diagrams that need to be shown, like circuit diagrams, to help you learn more about it. I got to a point where it was saying, oh, here's a circuit diagram, look at this. But it wasn't really showing anything; it didn't show any images. As far as I know, I've never seen Gemini show me an image.",30,30
34,en_participant_0034,Q5,Visual Technique Limitation,Medium,negative,"take woodworking, for example; it can't show me an actual technique. I want to get my planing technique right. What do I do if I'm hand planing? I have to go find that on YouTube myself and go, okay, this is how it looks.",30,30
34,en_participant_0034,Q8,Prompt Guidance Desire,High,positive,"For me, one of the biggest aspects of using AI effectively is the prompts. The key to utilizing AI well lies in how you prompt it, the amount of information you provide, and the level of detail you include so that it can deliver better information ... a perfect AI would assist the user with those prompts by saying, ""Okay, this is what you have, and these are the things you've missed. What kind of depth would you like? What would you like in the background? How do you envision this?""",44,44
34,en_participant_0034,Q8,Actionable Tangible Plans,High,positive,"I think also suggesting tangibles in the way that I use AI or creating some kind of plan around things would be helpful. For example, if we had diagnosed my tree in the garden, it could provide specific actions to take, like what you should do, what you need to do, and the timelines for each task.",48,48
34,en_participant_0034,Q8,Calendar Integration Priority,High,positive,"Can I integrate this with my Google Calendar or create a file that I can use to integrate into my Google Calendar? If someone wants to connect Google to the AI, it could send reminders in my calendar for when I need to buy fertilizer, when I need to buy antifungal, when I need to apply it, how much, and how often.",48,48
34,en_participant_0034,Q9,Selective Integration Need,Medium,neutral,"For me, my biggest issue is forgetting about things and forgetting when to do things. So that's why the calendar integration is probably the most important thing. I don't see anywhere else that I would want that.",53,53
34,en_participant_0034,Q11,AI Lacks Relational Depth,High,negative,"I think it comes down to surface-level issues. AI specifically can't relate to certain things that I'm speaking about, like being forgetful or the gardening topics, where a human would be able to engage more deeply. A human might say, ""Oh, has this happened? Have you seen...?"" There's just a deeper level of conversation between humans than between a human and an AI.",63,63
34,en_participant_0034,Q11,Limited Contextual Extension,Medium,negative,"The AI will ask questions based on exactly what I've said, while a human would ask questions based on an extension of what I said. For example, if I talk about gardening, a human might ask about nurseries or specific plants, whereas AI would just ask about gardening because I mentioned it.",63,63
