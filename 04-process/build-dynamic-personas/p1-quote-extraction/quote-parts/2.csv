2,en_participant_0002,Q4,AI As Excel Shortcut,High,positive,"I use AI to streamline the process of analyzing that data, such as aggregates, projections, and pivot tables.

2,en_participant_0002,Q5,Self-Censorship Over Privacy,High,negative,"Not so much couldn't, I'm probably more under the realm of shouldn't. I'm thinking about some privacy concerns. What is it that I want to put into, you know, do I particularly want to train somebody else's model, and what happens to that data after the fact?

What I mean by that is, you know, direct answers sometimes, as opposed to long, meandering responses. So, learning or being told how I would want to receive that information, just not what the information would be.",51,51
2,en_participant_0002,Q8,Multi-Platform Availability,Medium,neutral,"being available on multiple platforms seems like a fairly basic requirement—desktop, mobile, you know, near-instantaneous responses and high availability.",55,55
2,en_participant_0002,Q9,Autonomous Async AI Appeal,High,positive,"can I ask you to send an email at some point in the future? Or, you know, other things that aren't synchronous but are asynchronous activities?",60,60
2,en_participant_0002,Q9,Periodic Background Monitoring,Medium,positive,"if I wanted to book a flight, let's say, to London, to check the flights now and also periodically look up the prices of flights every five days for the next couple of weeks and let me know when the prices change.",64,64
