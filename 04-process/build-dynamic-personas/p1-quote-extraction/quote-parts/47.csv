47,en_participant_0047,Q4,ChatGPT As Search Engine,High,neutral,I use ChatGPT almost as a replacement for Google.,16,16
47,en_participant_0047,Q4,Social Advice Seeking,High,neutral,"I also ask more personal questions, like, is it normal to feel X, Y, Z, or what is the easiest way for me to tell my friend that I can't attend X, Y, Z without hurting their feelings.",16,16
47,en_participant_0047,Q4,Task Range Diversity,Medium,neutral,"it ranges from literature interpretation and summarizing scientific literature to just menial personal tasks, and also as a search engine.",16,16
47,en_participant_0047,Q4,Interpersonal Deliberation Support,High,positive,"It helps me find my wording. It helps me sometimes work on my tone, or occasionally, if I give a scenario, it will come up with a lot of different angles regarding some of the different variables at play.",20,20
47,en_participant_0047,Q4,Impulse Mitigation,High,positive,"It helps me understand whether or not I've considered all the possible angles and address them. So, it helps me react a little bit less impulsively and helps me process the situation.",20,20
47,en_participant_0047,Q4,Dense Text Distillation,High,positive,"When processing complex information, there are times when the text is really dense and I don't want to read all of it ... I can spend a lot of time combing through that dense text. It can be helpful to distill some of the higher-level conclusions, making it easier to find a through line without it being so wordy.",24,24
47,en_participant_0047,Q5,Scientific Literature Access Limitation,Medium,negative,"I've wanted to use it to help with the interpretation of scientific literature. I've wanted to upload entire articles or even source articles that are publicly available through platforms like PubMed. However, it just didn't seem to have the necessary computing power.",29,29
47,en_participant_0047,Q5,Hallucination Risk Concern,High,negative,"I don't fully trust it. I mean, yes, it can process this information for me, but the worst-case scenario is that I end up with an interpretation that is incorrect, and it could be woefully incorrect due to a hallucination or something like that.",29,29
47,en_participant_0047,Q5,Constant Verification Need,High,negative,"I can use it to a degree, but I feel like I'm always policing and checking the results.",29,29
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Unbiased Reasoning Imperative,High,negative,"The number one most important thing for an AI assistant for me is unbiased, objective, evidence-based reasoning. We live in a world filled with lies and conspiracies, and there is a complete lack of trust in institutions.",43,43
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,AI Bias As Existential Threat,High,negative,"The idea that an AI tool could suddenly have bias, especially in a moment where there is a very palpable slide towards fascism, is terrifying, particularly because people really trust the advice, findings, and insights of these tools.",43,43
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Confirmation Bias Self-Awareness,Medium,mixed,I know it's not fully unbiased and it tends to give me confirmation bias on some of the things I already think.,43,43
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Memory Continuity Need,High,negative,"I think it would have continuity and memory over time. With chat, I find that when I ask it questions, like, ""Hey, I got paid on this day,"" it often changes with holidays and things like that ... if I got paid on this day, when do I expect to get paid again? They answer, but then I don't even remember when I last got paid, and when I ask again, they say, ""No, remind me. Do you get paid biweekly or whatever?"" And I think, okay, great. I'm going to have to do this exercise all over again.",45,45
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Relationship Building With AI,High,positive,"This perfect AI assistant, with memory continuity and unbiased reasoning, would be better because it would allow you to build a more long-term relationship. It would learn about you, how you've changed, how you've grown, and how your opinions have evolved.",49,49
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Rumination Pattern Detection,Medium,positive,It could also identify things that you keep getting stuck on and ruminating over for longer than you should. I feel like that's really helpful.,49,49
47,en_participant_0047,Q8,Personal Bias Checking Support,Medium,neutral,"I think it would help more with interpersonal questions, like motivations, lack of motivations, and why I might feel a certain way. It could potentially help me dig deeper into my own personal biases.",53,53
47,en_participant_0047,Q9,ADHD Executive Function Gap,High,positive,"I would love it if the tool could just schedule things for me, manage my calendar, move things around, and remind me when I need to start doing a task. I have ADHD, and that would be unbelievable.",58,58
47,en_participant_0047,Q9,Thought-To-Action Automation,High,positive,"If I could just, in the moment, say, ""Hey, please schedule this and include these people,"" without having to go in, write an email, or do all the steps, that would be great.",58,58
47,en_participant_0047,Q11,Live Feedback Preference,Medium,positive,I think having live feedback is always a little better because it helps you figure out whether or not you're going down a coherent path.,68,68
47,en_participant_0047,Q11,Energy Preservation Through AI,High,positive,"sometimes it's nice to not have to talk to a person. I avoid people sometimes because I just have no energy. So, yeah, it's amazing not having to talk to a person.",68,68
47,en_participant_0047,Q12,Non-Judgmental Sharing Space,High,positive,"I feel like I say all kinds of things to ChatGPT that maybe I wouldn't say to my friends because ChatGPT has no sense of self, I guess. So, I'm fairly comfortable, I guess.",72,72
47,en_participant_0047,Q12,Safe Data Gathering Relationship,High,positive,"ChatGPT cannot form opinions about me with judgment. It just gathers data about me, and I think that's helpful. It's not going to change its ability to be there for me. It's not going to reject what I say. It's not going to judge what I say. It's just going to gather data, and that's helpful if you leverage it, in my opinion.",76,76
