16,en_participant_0016,Q4,DIY Image Assessment,High,positive,"I like to use AI to assess some of the images that I upload as a form of DIY. I take pictures of a broken wall or a broken wall socket, anything that I don't know how to manage myself, and then I get AI to analyze it. It tells me how much paint I need to buy and where I can purchase whatever tools I need for the do-it-yourself home project.",16,16
16,en_participant_0016,Q4,Recipe And Kitchen Use,Medium,positive,I also use AI quite a lot for conjuring up recipes if I have a certain ingredient in my fridge and I want to know what I can make with it or to create a shopping list for certain recipes.,16,16
16,en_participant_0016,Q4,Limited Personal Use,Medium,neutral,That is the extent of my personal use of AI right now.,16,16
16,en_participant_0016,Q4,Multimodal Interaction Preference,High,positive,"I enjoy taking pictures, loading the images, and then sometimes, with a voice prompt, I like to explain what it is that I want AI to do for me. If the voice prompt is not possible, I would use text.",20,20
16,en_participant_0016,Q5,Paywall Limitation Awareness,High,negative,"The only time I could think of was when I was using a free version of ChatGPT. I obviously couldn't access the extended features that I wanted to use. I couldn't upload any images, and that prevented me from using AI the way I needed to.",25,25
16,en_participant_0016,Q5,Switched To Paid Version,Medium,positive,"Therefore, I switched to the paid version, which then obviously changed things for me.",25,25
16,en_participant_0016,Q6,Moderate Trust In AI,Medium,neutral,3 - Moderate trust,30,30
16,en_participant_0016,Q8,3D Model Visualization Gap,High,negative,"I would do all the measurements in a room. I would measure the windows, the walls, the height, and the length, and I would input it exactly as it is. I would then ask AI to give me a 3D model to scale of all those measurements, but for some reason, it didn't matter how perfect I was with inputting the measurements; it could not give me a 3D model.",39,39
16,en_participant_0016,Q8,Ideal 3D Visualization Feature,High,positive,"It would have been cool if AI could mark up the 3D room to my specifications exactly as it is. And if I could tell AI to paint the walls a certain color so that I can visualize what it would look like, that would be amazing.",39,39
16,en_participant_0016,Q8,Holistic Interior Design Assistant,High,positive,"If it could calculate the amount of paint that I need, what it would cost me, the building expenses, and everything with it while visualizing it or showing me a visual representation, I think that would be great as a personal assistant. I would be able to save a lot of money and time with that.",39,39
16,en_participant_0016,Q8,Smart Kitchen Inventory Tracking,High,positive,"I think a perfect AI assistant could also help me know when certain ingredients or products in my kitchen are running out. It could help me keep track of my electricity usage and give me notifications for when I need to buy certain items, like when I need to purchase new electricity, when the milk is going to go sour, or when my eggs are running low.",43,43
16,en_participant_0016,Q8,Aggregation And Planning Desire,Medium,positive,It could compile a list and a time frame to keep track of these things.,43,43
16,en_participant_0016,Q9,Smartphone Only Device Landscape,Medium,neutral,"Well, at this stage, I only have a smartphone. I do not have smart home devices.",47,47
16,en_participant_0016,Q9,Smart Fridge Integration Interest,Medium,positive,"It would be amazing if I had a fridge that was smart enough to tell me when my milk is about to go sour; that would be great. However, it would obviously also need to be linked to my smartphone so that I can control the notifications and possibly take it with me to the shops if I do the shopping or if I do delivery shopping purchases.",47,47
16,en_participant_0016,Q9,Calendar Based Predictive Notifications,High,positive,"Well, that would obviously allow me to, if AI could be connected to my calendar, it could say, on this date, you are bound to probably run out of X, Y, Z. That could prompt me to open a shopping app that maybe already has the shopping basket kind of prepopulated, or it could notify me that I need to buy electricity, etcetera, etcetera.",52,52
16,en_participant_0016,Q11,Relaxation Without Visual Judgment,High,positive,"I felt a little bit more relaxed because I didn't feel like I needed to worry about my presentation or whether or not I brushed or combed my hair or had makeup on. I suppose I don't feel like there's a human judgmental aspect behind this type of interview style, which makes it easier to show up.",62,62
16,en_participant_0016,Q11,No Pressure To Impress AI,High,positive,"Yeah, I definitely think it affects how open or detailed I am in my responses. I suppose when you deal with humans, there's that human aspect where you almost don't want to let the interviewer down. You sometimes say things that you think the interviewer maybe wants to hear instead of actually expressing what you really think. I think it's a very human approach, a very human thing to try to either impress or make the interviewer happy.",66,66
16,en_participant_0016,Q11,AI Elicits Greater Truthfulness,High,neutral,"I think it could drastically affect the quality or the truthfulness of responses. Obviously, I believe people would be a lot more truthful when speaking to AI because they would feel there is no judgment.",70,70
16,en_participant_0016,Q11,Human Rapport Trade-Off,Medium,neutral,"However, with human interviews, there could be a familiarity with a good human interviewer that makes people feel at ease and creates great rapport, which could then, in effect, elicit a different type of response.",70,70
