44,en_participant_0044,Q4,Multi-Domain Learning Pattern,High,positive,"I typically use AI, like Perplexity and Gemini, to get deeper answers on various topics, whether it's finance-related, stock-related, politics-related, woodworking-related, or pretty much anything I'm interested in.",16,16
44,en_participant_0044,Q4,Teaching Financial Literacy,High,positive,"Yeah, so I built a finance tracking app for my kids. Anytime they get any money, they put it in the bank of debt, and then they can check their balance. They can see how much interest they're accruing, and basically, it helps them learn about spending, saving, and good financial principles.",20,20
44,en_participant_0044,Q4,Critical Thinking Tool,High,positive,"Typically, in the political arena, if there's a question or something that's going on, I'll start asking questions and trying to get to the heart of whatever issue it is, trying to correct any blind spots I may have and get outside my own preconceived ideas about particular issues.",24,24
44,en_participant_0044,Q4,Source Discovery Value,Medium,positive,I find that a large language model is good at uncovering new sources or different ideas or tracing back where specific ideas come from to the original source.,24,24
44,en_participant_0044,Q5,Image Generation Failure,High,negative,"So, where I've tried to use generative AI has typically been around image generation. ... I wanted to use AI to generate the images, but I just couldn't get the image that was in my head out in the tool, and it just kind of sucked.",29,29
44,en_participant_0044,Q5,Prompt Control Frustration,High,negative,"every time I would describe it and try to get the AI to generate the image, it was just all over the place or the wording was just gibberish. It wasn't actually using the words that I wanted where I wanted them, and I couldn't get it to directly place things where I wanted them.",33,33
44,en_participant_0044,Q8,Task Organization Need,High,positive,"I think the perfect AI assistant would help me organize, prioritize, and categorize all tasks, whether work or personal. It would help me figure out where I need to spend more of my time.",47,47
44,en_participant_0044,Q8,Idea Capture Pain,High,negative,"I typically have a thousand different ideas for a thousand different things. But, you know, if I don't put them down into a notebook or into a task list, they just kind of disappear.",51,51
44,en_participant_0044,Q8,Execution Planning,High,positive,"if there's a way that I could track all that and then come up with an action item plan of how to actually take this idea and put it into a real-life situation and actually make it work, that's kind of what I'm looking for. It would be able to track all that and then give me a plan of next steps",51,51
44,en_participant_0044,Q8,Goal-Aligned Prioritization,High,positive,"it should prioritize based on my larger overarching goals for the year, for that quarter, and for that month. So, like, every year, I do yearly planning and try to figure out what I want to do for the next year. Based on those goals and priorities, that's how it should organize.",55,55
44,en_participant_0044,Q9,System Integration,High,positive,"Yeah, I think it would be helpful to have email, calendar, voice notes, meeting notes, meeting summaries, and overall task lists. We just got some fancy chore list calendar thing for the kitchen that helps the kids prioritize tasks. If it were integrated with that, that would be cool.",60,60
44,en_participant_0044,Q9,Unified Task Processing,High,positive,"Well, again, whatever comes through email, whatever is on my calendar, and whatever voice notes I have, it should just take those, organize them, sort them, prioritize them, and then show me a task list for every day.",64,64
44,en_participant_0044,Q11,Human Interview Preference,High,mixed,"Being interviewed by an AI is different in that, I think with a human, there's more relationship, more reciprocity, and more of a conversation. There's a greater back and forth. With an AI, there's none of that, so it relies on me to carry the conversation.",74,74
44,en_participant_0044,Q11,AI Dynamic Follow-Up Value,Medium,positive,"the AI was able to pick up on things that I had said and ask a follow-up question about that with a specific follow-up rather than just a generic ""tell me more about why you gave the answer you did"" type of question.",78,78
44,en_participant_0044,Q11,Personalized Interviewing,Medium,positive,"I think it just makes it a little bit more personalized. Putting the specific tools that I mentioned into the task response keeps you on track a little bit more. ... With AI, it can do it on its own a little bit easier, and you don't have to be as skilled.",82,82
