45,en_participant_0045,Q4,Search Synthesis Primary Need,High,positive,"I think most of my personal tasks for AI are honestly the Google summary that happens at the top of the search right now. Because I don't know, I'm a pretty curious person, so I'm constantly googling things. The ability to synthesize information is probably the number one thing that search takes care of and that I need.",16,16
45,en_participant_0045,Q4,Verification Through Attribution Check,High,neutral,"I will say, that's not in the prompt, but I take it with a grain of salt, and I always make sure to look at the attribution of the links because I know that the summaries can be wrong.",16,16
45,en_participant_0045,Q4,Research Verification Pattern,High,neutral,It's not a foolproof thing; it's usually like getting started with a summary and then continuing my own research to verify if what's in the summary is true or if there are other angles.,16,16
45,en_participant_0045,Q4,ChatGPT For Complex Task Analysis,High,neutral,I also sometimes use ChatGPT if I have a slightly more complicated task that I need to do where the search query would be too narrow or I actually need it to perform some analysis for me.,18,18
45,en_participant_0045,Q4,Computation Task Example,Medium,neutral,"For example, I'm going to be taking some leave, and I needed to calculate how much PTO and sick leave I'd be accruing during that period of time leading up to the leave. I used ChatGPT to help me figure out how many workdays there are between x date and y date.",18,18
45,en_participant_0045,Q5,Vague Requirements Caused Failure,Medium,negative,"I asked it to do some computation, and I wasn't being specific enough about what I wanted. Then I just ran out of free credits, and I didn't want to pay for it.",31,31
45,en_participant_0045,Q5,Data Aggregation Mismatch,Medium,negative,"I think it was something like I fed it a spreadsheet and asked it to calculate some things in a particular way, or aggregate the data in a specific way, but it didn't end up doing it the way I needed it to.",35,35
45,en_participant_0045,Q6,Moderate Trust Assessment,Medium,neutral,3 - Moderate trust,40,40
45,en_participant_0045,Q8,Current Tools Adequate,Medium,positive,"Honestly, the AI tools that I use right now feel pretty adequate for what I need them to be. Maybe it's because I kind of know what I should be using them for and what they're not good for, and I kind of self-limit.",49,49
45,en_participant_0045,Q8,Confidence Level Transparency Need,High,positive,"I think the number one thing is, does the AI have an awareness of its own level of credibility or trust? Can it give you a rating that's like, I am X percent confident that the results I'm giving you today are accurate, or this is from 10 sources versus five sources?",49,49
45,en_participant_0045,Q8,Categorical Confidence Preference,High,neutral,"I think I actually want something that's more like a human scale or more categorical, or that gives me a better sense of my next step. So it's like, I'm pretty confident this is right, but you probably want to check a few things, or like, I'm not very confident this is right. You should enter this query in a bunch more times, or like, I'm very confident this is right, and here's why.",53,53
45,en_participant_0045,Q9,Admin And Task Prioritization Need,High,positive,"The biggest thing I can think of is just the admin that my husband and I have to do to manage our social life and also our tasks that we need to get done throughout the week. If there was a way, I don't know how this would work, but something that could help me see what's coming up, anticipate what's ahead, and also rank order what's most important to tackle now.",62,62
45,en_participant_0045,Q11,Privacy Concern About Personal Disclosure,High,negative,"I didn't sign any privacy agreement with this thing. I don't know where the data goes. I mean, does the whole internet know that I'm pregnant now or that I'm thinking about breastfeeding? Probably not. In fact, surely not, but it just feels different than having someone in front of you who can reassure you that your information is private and confidential, and who you know has been trained to think about those things that way, ideally.",72,72
45,en_participant_0045,Q11,Scope Clarity Uncertainty,Medium,negative,"The other issue was that you started off by asking me very specifically about my personal AI experiences, and then we got a little vaguer as we went on. I wasn't sure if we were still talking about personal stuff or if you wanted me to start talking about work stuff, or if it was okay for me to start talking about work stuff.",72,72
45,en_participant_0045,Q11,Informed Consent For AI Interviews,High,neutral,"Just take the informed consent model that researchers have and apply it to an AI. Tell me how my data is going to be used, how it's going to be stored, what recourse I have for getting it deleted, or for stopping the interview at any time and having that information scrubbed.",76,76
