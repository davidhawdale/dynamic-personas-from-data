1,en_participant_0001,Q4,Ecological AI Restriction,High,negative,"for personal tasks, I really try to limit my use of AI, because for ecological reasons, I really want to restrict it to professional tasks. Even at a professional level, I always try to think if I can do it another way. So, for personal tasks, my use is very, very limited, if not nonexistent.",12,12
1,en_participant_0001,Q4,AI Energy Cost Awareness,High,negative,"using generative AI, for example, to do a search, consumes much more energy, water, and electricity than doing a search on Google. It's really something I'm aware of, and it's for these reasons that I really try to limit my use of AI to the bare minimum.",15,15
1,en_participant_0001,Q4,Ecological Avoidance Vacation,Medium,mixed,"I know it could save me time, but again, for the reasons I mentioned, I prefer not to do it.",18,18
1,en_participant_0001,Q5,Mobile AI Access Gap,Medium,neutral,"since I haven't downloaded ChatGPT or another AI application on my phone, my use is really limited to when I'm at home in front of my computer. So, all the situations where I could potentially use it on the go, but in any case, since I don't have the application, I don't do it.",22,22
1,en_participant_0001,Q5,Self-Sufficient Alternative Finding,Medium,neutral,I always have a solution. I haven't had a situation where I needed it excessively. I always manage to do as before and find an alternative solution to meet my needs.,25,25
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,Specialised Professional Assistants,High,positive,"Ideally, I would even have several assistants, each with a specific specialty, who could help me in my freelance activity on a daily basis. For example, an assistant who would manage all the administrative part, paperwork, sending invoices, an assistant who would help me with everything related to content strategy, helping me write content, especially on LinkedIn, and then an assistant who would have more of a sales role and would help me with all the prospecting and potential client outreach.",35,35
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,LinkedIn Content Creation Need,Medium,positive,"The content strategy assistant would actually help me with everything related to content creation, so mainly for me on LinkedIn, to help me write quality posts without it taking too much time.",38,38
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,Invoice Admin Automation,Medium,positive,"This assistant would be more in a context where I have a lot of invoices to send. It would really help me with sending invoices, follow-ups if invoices are not paid on time, and all the administrative part related to services, with all the tasks to manage.",41,41
1,en_participant_0001,Q9,Email Sequence Automation Interest,Medium,positive,"maybe it could help me create email sequences more easily, instead of managing all that manually today. There would certainly be things that could be automated without needing, for example, to subscribe to a tool for all this CRM email sending part.",45,45
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,Written Format Preference,Medium,positive,"the fact that the questions are written, in the end, I find it less disturbing than the tool tested just before where it is really a conversation. I am more comfortable with the fact that here, the questions and follow-ups are done in writing.",55,55
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,AI Voice Skepticism,High,mixed,"I'm a bit more skeptical when AI takes the form of voice notes versus the written side. I think it's important to remember that we're talking to a machine, and for those reasons, I find it more fluid for me to interact this way.",58,58
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,Machine Transparency Preference,High,neutral,"the fact that exchanges are written, certainly, it's less human, but at least, there you go, it doesn't make the person in front maybe believe that they are interacting with a real human being. It really puts it in its rightful place, I think.",61,61
