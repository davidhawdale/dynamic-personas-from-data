35,en_participant_0035,Q4,Multi-Parameter Trip Planning,High,positive,"I use AI for similar kinds of tasks that I would use Google for, but with more complicated queries. For example, when I'm planning a trip that's three days long in a specific location and I have dietary requirements and specific interests, I can pass all of those parameters to the AI, and it can create an itinerary for me.",16,16
35,en_participant_0035,Q4,Code Generation And Problem Solving,High,positive,Another thing I use AI for is generating code and fixing problems in my code.,16,16
35,en_participant_0035,Q4,Iterative Code Assistance,High,positive,"In the past, I used AI to completely generate code from scratch in languages that I was not familiar with, but I stopped doing that because I realized I couldn't extend the app. AI tends to produce quite a lot of extra code, and it's not always efficient. So these days, I use AI to help me when I have the skeleton of an idea and I have enough knowledge to make the application myself.",24,24
35,en_participant_0035,Q4,Efficiency Without Understanding Loss,Medium,positive,"I'm just speeding up some processes by getting it to generate code, while making sure that I understand the code and also helping me make the code more efficient.",24,24
35,en_participant_0035,Q5,AI Design Limitations,High,negative,"I've used AI to generate designs for me as a product designer. I provide the requirements, and it generates mock-ups for me. I found that while it can create visually appealing mock-ups, it tends to put me in a box. It often just copies the UI of other websites and doesn't deeply understand the problems I'm trying to solve.",29,29
35,en_participant_0035,Q5,Creative Inhibition Effect,High,negative,"Additionally, having seen ideas from the AI, it hinders my ability to think creatively because I tend to iterate off the ideas that the AI generated.",29,29
35,en_participant_0035,Q5,Narrow Solution Framing,Medium,negative,"I think it gives me a solution, and I tend to think more narrowly based on its solution rather than thinking broadly and coming up with a bunch of ideas on my own.",33,33
35,en_participant_0035,Q8,Autonomous Admin Task Delegation,High,positive,"It would be great if AI could autonomously handle administrative tasks that I don't want to do. For example, paying invoices, rescheduling doctor's appointments, interpreting results from the doctor, and understanding if the contract my landlord sent me is fair and if I could negotiate on it.",47,47
35,en_participant_0035,Q8,Creative Time Reallocation,Medium,positive,"Basically, I would like it to proactively manage the admin tasks that I would do myself, freeing up my time to focus on more creative work.",47,47
35,en_participant_0035,Q8,Legal Contract Assessment,Medium,neutral,"As an example, I'm negotiating a German rental contract at the moment, and I'm not sure the clauses in the contract are entirely fair. Instead of Googling or using AI for hours to try to figure it out, I would like the AI to tell me if the contract is fair.",51,51
35,en_participant_0035,Q8,Proactive Event Coordination,Medium,positive,"For example, booking trips, finding the best flights, and coordinating dates with the people I'm traveling with. Another example is that I have a friend in town this week, and he wants to go out next weekend. I know the kind of things he would like, but I'm going to manually search for what events are on. If it could proactively give me some options for events, that would be helpful—things like this.",55,55
35,en_participant_0035,Q9,System Interconnection Requirement,High,neutral,I think it would need to be connected to those apps in order to autonomously do things on my behalf.,60,60
35,en_participant_0035,Q9,AI Reliability Concern,High,negative,"However, at the moment, I would not allow the AI to autonomously do things because it still makes mistakes.",60,60
35,en_participant_0035,Q9,Privacy Data Access Resistance,High,negative,"Realistically, I probably would not give the AI that much access to my personal data because I would be concerned about the privacy implications of that.",60,60
35,en_participant_0035,Q11,AI Interview Similarity,Low,neutral,"This feels quite similar to answering a survey but doing it with video. I noticed that the AI asked follow-up questions based on what I said, which I think is pretty cool, but it feels quite similar to answering a static survey.",70,70
35,en_participant_0035,Q11,Follow-Up Value Acknowledgment,Low,positive,"If I think about being on the other side, I can imagine it's quite helpful for the AI to ask follow-up questions rather than it just being a static survey.",74,74
35,en_participant_0035,Q11,Personal Survey Experience,Low,neutral,"However, my experience as a person answering these questions feels quite similar to a static survey.",74,74
