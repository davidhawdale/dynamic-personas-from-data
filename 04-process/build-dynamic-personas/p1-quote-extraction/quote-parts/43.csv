43,en_participant_0043,Q4,Health And Wellness Research,High,neutral,"I use AI when I'm wondering about a health issue, looking for a gift for someone, investigating a problem out of my own interests or curiosity, or coming up with ideas for art projects and creative pursuits.",16,16
43,en_participant_0043,Q4,Citation Transparency Preference,High,positive,I like Google Gemini for that. It shows me the citations and where it's getting the information from.,20,20
43,en_participant_0043,Q4,AI For Creative Pattern Design,High,positive,"I'm working on a small miniature curio cabinet, and I used ChatGPT to help me produce a pattern. It was a design based on folk floral patterns, for which I provided the size specifications. It was almost right, but I just had to stretch it out.",24,24
43,en_participant_0043,Q5,Always On Device Access,High,positive,"I always have my phone available, and I have ChatGPT on my phone. Google uses AI on my phone, so I really don't feel like there's a chance where I'm unable to access it.",29,29
43,en_participant_0043,Q8,Project Context Memory,High,positive,"I think a perfect AI assistant would be able to keep track of my various projects so that I can quickly say, ""Please send an email to so-and-so about this detail."" It would know which project I'm referring to and the person I'm talking about.",43,43
43,en_participant_0043,Q8,Integrated Workflow Needs,High,positive,"It would be able to retrieve that person's email address and start composing an email for me based on the history of the project. My assistant would also be able to browse online and make suggestions for different purchases for items I need to shop for, as well as create calendar events, marketing materials, and all the things that revolve around the various projects I'm working on and my personal life.",43,43
43,en_participant_0043,Q8,Shopping Friction From Accessibility,Medium,negative,"I have tricky shoe problems, for instance. I need a size twelve women's, but one foot is a half size larger and one foot is a size smaller than the other. I've got flat feet and bunions, and it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, I wind up scouring the Internet, ordering shoes, and sending them back.",47,47
43,en_participant_0043,Q8,Research Assistance For Shopping,High,positive,"It would be great if I could find an AI assistant that could do more of that research for me, save me some time, read the reviews, and maybe look at my historical purchasing habits to see what I might have better luck with.",47,47
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,ChatGPT Project Context Success,High,positive,"Coordinating projects in my personal life has already improved a lot in that area because of organizing projects in ChatGPT. It has a history of conversation and can feed in documents, so it knows the context when I'm asking a question.",51,51
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,Calendar Integration Desire,Medium,positive,I just want to expand on that and allow integration with my calendar and other apps that might feed into those projects.,51,51
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,In-Conversation Task Creation,Medium,positive,"For scheduling, while I'm having a conversation with it, I might decide that I want to apply for this grant. It's helping me write the proposal, and now I want to remember to follow up. So, can you please create a calendar reminder? Maybe it could do that for me, that kind of thing.",51,51
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,Platform Integration Friction,High,negative,"Something like Canva would be great, where it might integrate with a marketing material editing platform that has suggestions for formatting and templates and that kind of thing, so that I don't have to transfer information from one to the other.",56,56
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,Copy-Paste Data Transfer Burden,High,negative,"Maybe a Microsoft Word integration directly allowing me to edit a document that I'm working on with ChatGPT rather than copying and pasting. Excel integration would be fantastic. Again, I'm often copying and pasting large amounts of data, and sometimes I have to really hand-feed it information from specific columns or lines because there's too much for the AI to understand separately.",56,56
43,en_participant_0043,Q9,Workflow Efficiency Vision,Medium,positive,So that would save a lot of time. It would allow me to create smarter spreadsheets and better visualizations. I think it would just improve my workflow all around.,56,56
43,en_participant_0043,Q11,Human Voice Preference,Medium,negative,"I like having conversations with human beings. I enjoy hearing a voice, so not hearing a voice feels kind of impersonal.",66,66
43,en_participant_0043,Q11,AI Listening Advantage,Medium,positive,"Sometimes your interviewer doesn't listen as well as an AI might, so that's something to consider.",66,66
43,en_participant_0043,Q11,Voice Recording Novelty,Low,positive,"It was really neat that I was able to vocalize my responses, and you can analyze them as we go.",66,66
43,en_participant_0043,Q11,Human Cognitive Limitations In Listening,High,neutral,"While humans have complex brains, we sometimes think about the next question while the person we're interviewing is answering the last one. We might get distracted and only selectively hear parts of someone's response rather than having the rational distance to remember the various parts of their answer and follow up on them.",70,70
43,en_participant_0043,Q11,Human Interviewer Advantage,High,positive,"There are interesting aspects to human interviews because we each have our own perspective and experience that comes into play when we're interviewing someone. A person's personality is involved, along with humor, compassion, and empathy.",74,74
