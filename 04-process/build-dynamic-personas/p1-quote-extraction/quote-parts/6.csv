6,en_participant_0006,Q4,AI As Pre-Filter,High,positive,It acts as a pre-filter before I reach out to the vet.,16,16
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Speed Over Search,High,positive,"ChatGPT is likely to give me an answer that's at least 80% accurate, compared to Googling, which results in a bunch of website links that I then have to sift through to find the answer. So, it's quicker if I just ask.",16,16
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Iterative Narrowing Dialogue,High,neutral,"I do a sequence of conversations, so I don't just ask one question and then get the answer. I normally start with a question that gives a general idea of what's happening, and then I receive an answer. After that, I narrow it down further, and it provides me with another answer, which I narrow down even more.",20,20
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Sponsored Content Distrust,Medium,negative,looking at recommendations online is very difficult because there's a lot of paid sponsorship that is disguised as articles. It's hard to know for sure if something was not sponsored to give a good review versus a genuine review.,24,24
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Prompt Labor Cost,High,negative,The level of specificity I needed to provide was more work for me than if I just did the animations myself. The amount of labor it would have taken to work through the AI to get it to function and produce what I wanted was just too much.,29,29
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Creative Vision Gap,High,negative,"it's very difficult to get the image that you actually have in your head for the judge for any AI to reproduce. That is actually very hard. They might create something you really like or something that's somewhat within the frame of what you're thinking, but it's not going to recreate what you actually were thinking of.",33,33
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Nuance Complexity Barrier,High,negative,"you have to create a prompt that indicates and defines all those nuances in a syntax that's understandable by the AI so that it can at least provide you with a result that's within the ballpark of what you want. The more nuances there are, the more likely it is that you'll miss it, either because it's just not intelligent enough or your prompt was not good enough.",35,35
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Accuracy Primary Requirement,High,negative,"accurate information will always be the most important factor ... the most difficult aspect of AI assistance right now is that they are not accurate, and there's also no way to know which parts are not accurate, especially if you're not an expert in the field that we're discussing.",49,49
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Source Mismatch Frustration,High,negative,"if I'm asking for a tutorial on how to use a relatively new tool in Figma, it might give me an answer that sounds like it's about that tool. However, when I check the source, it's actually a tutorial for a similar but different tool. I then have to spend time reading through that to realize, oh, this is not accurate; it's just assuming that this one tool can be used the same way as the other one.",53,53
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Cross-Conversation Memory Gap,High,negative,"it would be better if the AI had a stronger memory of the conversations it has with users. Within a single chat, it remembers the conversation quite well, but it still misses some parts or gets confused. It doesn't really transfer information from other conversations effectively.",57,57
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Cross-Reference Desired,Medium,mixed,It would be helpful if it could remember when I talked about something in another chat and cross-reference those discussions. I believe that would enhance the experience significantly.,57,57
6,en_participant_0006,Q9,Integration Value Skepticism,High,mixed,the question for me is whether it really shortens the time I spend on these tools. Is it really improving them?,62,62
6,en_participant_0006,Q9,AI As Shortcuts Only,High,neutral,"how I see AI being integrated into tools is more like shortcuts. It can add shortcuts to things, but it can't really provide full-fledged functionality, basically.",62,62
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Survey Not Interview,High,negative,"It feels more like a survey, like a form survey with video recording in it, rather than an actual interview.",72,72
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Generic Follow-Up Feeling,Medium,negative,"The way this has been structured feels very generic and general. It does refer back to something you said earlier, but not in a specific niche way.",76,76
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Deviation Value Recognition,Medium,mixed,"In human interviews, you can go off the path, which can be both good and bad. Sometimes, it is in those deviations that you find interesting pieces of information.",76,76
