14,en_participant_0014,Q4,Practical AI Verification,High,positive,"I think it's Google Lens, which then gave me an AI interpretation that pretty much lined up with what the mechanic said at the end of the week. I was pretty impressed with that.",16,16
14,en_participant_0014,Q4,AI Use Cases Inventory,Medium,neutral,"I use AI to help me interpret search results, summarize search results, identify physical things, and find manuals for them.",16,16
14,en_participant_0014,Q4,Human Verification Preference,High,positive,"Yeah, so I knew that I wanted a beach holiday ... I asked ChatGPT to identify a couple of small coastal towns that were family-friendly ... This really helped me narrow things down ... I also spoke to my husband about these towns, and one of them he had actually been to, so it was kind of like human verification.",26,26
14,en_participant_0014,Q5,Context Is Key Constraint,High,neutral,"It kind of didn't read or interpret what I wanted. But again, I don't see that as an AI problem. AI is not plugged into my brain; I still have to give it something to go on.",33,33
14,en_participant_0014,Q5,Iterative Refinement Mindset,Medium,neutral,"Again, I don't think I really notice when AI doesn't give me the results I expect because I'm used to taking the results and fine-tuning things, providing a little more information until I arrive at what I want.",37,37
14,en_participant_0014,Q6,Moderate Trust Level,Medium,neutral,3 - Moderate trust,42,42
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Brain Offload Fantasy,High,mixed,"Perfect personal AI assistant. But probably to take my mom brain and interpret all the things, plug into my brain, see everything gosh. It sounds very scary. But see everything I read, whether it's on WhatsApp or on school newsletters or hear about or talk about, and almost come up with a to do list or an events calendar.",51,51
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Cognitive Overhead Concern,High,negative,"So, yeah, just kind of helping in day to day life ... a plug in on my brain to help me to sort out the mess so that I don't need to think about it, which is also a bit gross because, like, then what do I use my brain for? Like, it's just a filter.",51,51
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Emotional Overwhelm Pattern,High,negative,"Just that there is a lot, as a full-time employee and a mom of two. It's not necessarily that it's just overwhelming, but there is a lot going on.",55,55
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Time Sensitivity Paralysis,High,negative,"I think it's the ad hoc things as opposed to recurring tasks—things that need to get done and are time-sensitive. For example, when my car broke down, I needed to go to the auto electrician before my holiday, but I didn't make it. I felt almost stuck in a state of paralysis because of all the other things I had to do.",59,59
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Financial Guidance Need,Medium,positive,"It would be nice to have help with budgeting, like, ""Hey, March is a month with a lot of birthdays. You should start saving for them."" It could list the birthdays, how much goes into my bank account, and how much I typically spend on each person.",61,61
14,en_participant_0014,Q8,Read Only Financial Trust,Medium,negative,"I wouldn't want AI to be able to perform any transactions or movements of funds in my bank account. I would like it to have read-only access, if that makes sense.",65,65
14,en_participant_0014,Q9,Dashboard Vision,High,positive,"It would be cool to have a dashboard or something—a dashboard of tasks for the day. Oh my gosh, that would be amazing! Yeah, that I could visit every morning and sort my life out.",70,70
14,en_participant_0014,Q11,Less Intimidated By AI,Medium,positive,"I actually kind of liked it. I felt less intimidated, but, you know, with all my pauses and things that I had to think about and so on, I assumed that the AI was going to filter out that boring stuff. So I didn't feel like I was wasting the interviewer's time.",80,80
14,en_participant_0014,Q11,Context Picking Impressed,Medium,positive,"I was really impressed that it picked up on context. It would have been nice to have some sort of disclaimer ahead of time ... and, yeah, I was really impressed, like I said, about the context that it picked up on and delving deeper into topics that I mentioned. That was pretty cool.",80,80
14,en_participant_0014,Q11,Equal Treatment of AI,Low,neutral,I don't think that it affected my openness and honesty in the interview. I pretty much treated AI like I would a normal human.,84,84
