5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Practical Everyday AI Use,Medium,neutral,"I usually use it more to ask for recipes or look up a term I don't know, search for a product that I know might be sold on Amazon in another country, but not in Argentina.",12,12
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Knitting Pattern AI Failure,High,negative,"Once I asked for a knitting pattern, I like to knit and crochet, and I asked it to help me create a sweater pattern. It didn't work very well, but it was useful to get ideas on what colors I could combine.",12,12
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Color Matching Success,Medium,positive,"it did work well when I asked it to help me choose colors, to see which color matched with which or what colors from a pattern in a photo I had seen on Pinterest, where I could get similar colors that were all from the same yarn, let's say, the same brand and the same thickness.",15,15
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Yarn Quantity Miscalculation,High,negative,I asked it to help me calculate the amount of yarn I would need for a medium-sized sweater and it calculated too much yarn ... I ended up with double the yarn I needed.,15,15
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Content Creation Scaffolding,Medium,positive,"I used it to ask if there was any YouTuber in Argentina doing the same thing as me ... it did give me ideas on how I could structure a video if I decide to do it at some point, with a kind of script and ideas on what I can talk about.",18,18
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Broken Product Links,High,negative,"sometimes it doesn't work for me when I want to search or find a product to buy in Argentina. Many times it gives me links that lead nowhere or are not of the product I'm looking for, not even related.",22,22
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Wrong Yarn Substitute,High,negative,"the substitutes it gave me did not correspond to the thickness of yarn I needed to replace. For that reason, I feel it didn't work for me.",25,25
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Ignored User Clarification,High,negative,"I had clarified that please give me links to products that I could buy and it kept sending me the same links, so I feel it didn't work because of that.",25,25
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Proactive Prompt Improvement,High,mixed,"It would be nice if it could help me improve prompts without me having to ask. For example, if I'm in situations where I get frustrated because I ask for something and it doesn't deliver, it could help me understand how I should ask for it, so I also learn how to ask for things in the future. That's something I feel they don't do today.",35,35
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Preference Memory Desire,High,negative,"being able to solve things already knowing, without me having to explain every time what I want in repetitive tasks.

5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Travel Planning Unrealism,High,mixed,"it was a bit unrealistic in terms of the time we had and the things to visit. For example, in one day it expected us to go to six places, but the reality is that, being there, between the fatigue accumulating and there being many things to see, maybe you want to see something and stay a while watching it and not just see it and go to the next attraction.",39,39
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Availability Aware Suggestions,High,negative,"I would also have liked that, when we asked for ticket prices or hotel suggestions, it sent options with availability for those dates, because the suggestions it had were not available for the dates we had already given.",42,42
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Travel Agent Analogy,Medium,neutral,"I feel it would have been good if it acted a bit like a travel agent. I'm not asking it to book the tickets or pay for them for me, just to give concrete options that are available and that the itinerary makes sense.",42,42
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Persistent Context Per Chat,High,mixed,"I think I would just like to be able to save, maybe, like prompts or have a chat for this and not forget what that chat is for. For example, a chat for translations, but never forget that it always has to translate from Spanish to English. A chat where I put ingredients and it gives me recipes, and I don't have to remind it why I'm giving it ingredients and what I need it to return.",45,45

5,en_participant_0005,Q9,Event Preparation Reminders,Medium,positive,"if my event is a medical exam, that before going, a few hours before or a day before, that can be customizable, it reminds me and gives me tips to go prepared. For example, remember to bring the latest medical studies.",49,49
5,en_participant_0005,Q11,Less Nervous With AI,High,mixed,"it worries me a little less because there is no one watching me and I feel less evaluated. In my personal case, I think it refers to that.

5,en_participant_0005,Q11,Language Comfort Advantage,Medium,positive,"I can choose in which language I feel more comfortable speaking, and that's much better. That's an advantage I see.",56,56
