18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Exploratory Tool Testing,High,neutral,"One bucket is the exploration type of activity where I'm just trying to play with various AI tools that I've heard about from articles, short videos, and tutorials to see what they do.",16,16
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Multimedia Content Creation,High,positive,"For the ones that I do use more frequently now, there are two parts. One is to generate multimedia files that I will then share with my friends and family to illustrate a point, sometimes trying to be a bit sarcastic or fun.",16,16
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Conversational Tool Usage,High,neutral,"For the other conversational type of AI tools, I mainly use them either for running some ideas to see whether there's anything that I'm missing or I use them to afford recommendations.",16,16
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Recommendation Validation Process,Medium,neutral,"if I am in the mood for reading a new book in philosophy or thriller, I would ask for recommendations. Then, I might have a slightly deeper conversation with the AI to confirm whether the recommendation is the one that I'm looking for or not, and then I'll take their recommendation to actually search for it myself to see whether it's something I actually want to purchase.",16,16
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Accuracy As Essential Requirement,High,neutral,I think any new information is helpful as long as it's accurate and it's not hallucinated.,20,20
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Tool Adoption Driven By Curiosity,High,neutral,"Curiosity, mainly. Of course, I want to stay on top of the tools available in AI, one because of my job, and two, because I'm generally speaking, an efficiency-driven person.",24,24
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Efficiency As Core Motivation,High,neutral,"In other words, pretty lazy. So if there's something that a tool can do for me, I'd rather not do it myself.",24,24
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Tool Quality Gatekeeping,High,neutral,"the tool needs to be reliable, productive, and trustworthy. I would explore the tools myself to see how the interaction goes, and if I think that the return on investment is worth it, I'll continue to use it if it fits in my life.",24,24
18,en_participant_0018,Q4,Skepticism Of Marketing Claims,Medium,negative,I will also review the feedback from others on the tools ... I want to make sure that I'm actually using something or spending my time and effort on something that will actually work for me rather than something that somebody else wants me to use.,24,24
18,en_participant_0018,Q5,Capability Boundary Testing,Medium,neutral,I started my interaction with AI tools with the idea of just exploring the capabilities of those tools and where the boundaries are.,29,29
18,en_participant_0018,Q5,Image Text Editing Limitation,Low,negative,"when ChatGPT came about and there was the ability to ask ChatGPT to produce images with just prompts. I was trying really hard to ask ChatGPT to fix some typos in that image, but it just could not do it.",29,29

18,en_participant_0018,Q8,Privacy Boundary Setting,High,neutral,"I also would respect privacy. For example, I should initiate the touch points rather than the personal assistant initiating touch points.",43,43
18,en_participant_0018,Q8,Context-Dependent Tool Assessment,Low,neutral,"my definition of better will depend on the circumstance, so I can't give you a clear answer like an umbrella definition of good. It has to be rooted in the context.",43,43
18,en_participant_0018,Q8,Step-By-Step Task Transparency,High,positive,"if they can show me the things that they are doing step by step, I can spot whether there's any step that's slightly off track or not. I don't need a lot of details, just top-line summaries of activities would be good.",47,47
18,en_participant_0018,Q9,AI Calendar Integration Caution,Medium,negative,"Right now, I do not like AI to touch my calendar and emails too much. Well, they are doing that anyway, like Clockwise.",56,56
18,en_participant_0018,Q9,Transparency Requirement For AI Actions,High,neutral,"if they're doing it, it should be really marked clearly that this is an AI-generated recommendation or AI-generated meeting, etc.",56,56
18,en_participant_0018,Q9,AI Social Collaboration Integration,Medium,positive,"for personal use, I chat a lot with my friends and family ... my chat should sit alongside the other chats that I have, so I can very quickly pull something from the AI and send it to my friends and family or generate something for laughs.",56,56
18,en_participant_0018,Q9,Integration Risk Aversion,High,negative,I don't want AI to be integrated with any other digital tools that I'm using at the moment because then there's a large chunk of that tied to payment. I'd rather not have expensive mistakes until I know that the AI is as reliable as it could be.,56,56
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,AI Interview Neutrality,Low,neutral,"I don't mind. There's no real preference. It's once again a thing that I'm currently exploring, so any new learning is a good experience.",66,66
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,AI Understanding Uncertainty,High,negative,there are moments I wondered whether AI has captured everything or if it has missed some points.,66,66
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,Speech Recognition Concern,Medium,negative,"I also wondered about my accent and how fast or slow I talk, and with all the ums and fillers, will AI actually capture the key message accurately?",66,66
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,Async Convenience Preference,Medium,positive,"A good thing, a positive thing, is that I can do this asynchronously anytime, and I wouldn't feel sorry for the AI interviewer if I start early in the UK and think, oh, if they were a human, then they would be starting really early in the US just to accommodate my time preference.",66,66
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,Healthcare AI Accuracy Concern,High,negative,"What makes me uncertain about AI's understanding compared to a human interviewer are case studies that I've seen, read, and heard about where AI misinterprets crucial information, particularly in healthcare when AI is transcribing diagnoses ... The doctor said ""lungs,"" and AI thought they said ""liver."" Things like that are concerning.",70,70
18,en_participant_0018,Q11,AI Summary And Playback Expectation,High,negative,"AI doesn't play anything back to me in a consistent, structured format ... I don't see a whole summary or key points of summary. When you're interviewing with a human, occasionally the interviewer will say, ""Let me play back what I'm hearing,"" and that is a good skill for human interviewers.",70,70
