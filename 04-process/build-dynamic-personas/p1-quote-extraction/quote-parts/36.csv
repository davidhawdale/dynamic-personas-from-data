36,en_participant_0036,Q4,Formal Style Preference,Medium,positive,AI helped me bring precision to my sentences and adopt a slightly more formal and cordial style.,15,15
36,en_participant_0036,Q5,Banking Security Constraints,High,negative,"Using AI in a professional context, now we have a tool managed by data, but given the secure environment in which I work, in banking, it was very complicated to use, so ChatGPT for example.",22,22
36,en_participant_0036,Q8,Context Precision Requirement,High,neutral,"the most important thing a personal assistant can do is understand my request with very precise context, so that it can help me effectively while allowing me to make my personal modifications, but as little as possible.",35,35
36,en_participant_0036,Q8,Prompt Precision Expectation,High,neutral,It is therefore essential that the prompt is precise and that it manages to recognize the precision I give it.,35,35
36,en_participant_0036,Q8,Data Connection Gap,High,negative,"what would interest me is that it is directly connected, at least in my professional case, directly to our data and that it provides more precision. Because, at present, I give it a lot of context with variables, and it is not capable, at least with us, of retrieving these variables and therefore performing an analysis, for example.",38,38
36,en_participant_0036,Q8,Job Search Integration Interest,Medium,positive,"I had already tried, but there was already an AI assistant that allowed for the search of new professional positions and to apply directly to several positions that interest me.

36,en_participant_0036,Q9,System Integration Preference,High,positive,"Directly on software like Content Square, for example, and then it could also be made available directly on Google Meet, indeed, on Google Calendar and Mail.

36,en_participant_0036,Q9,Calendar Scheduling Assistance,Medium,positive,"on Google Calendar, it would allow for directly detecting occurrences with other collaborators whose schedule I am looking for and give me the occurrences that are directly available, for example, next week or the next two weeks.",48,48
36,en_participant_0036,Q9,Automated Meeting Reports Need,High,negative,"On Google Meet, for example, it would allow, although it already exists, but in our company, it is impossible, to generate automatic reports, which takes a lot of time and would allow for more precision regarding the reports.",48,48
36,en_participant_0036,Q11,AI Interview Limitations,Medium,negative,"there is less context, less possibility to explain why I am doing this interview and to ask other questions, and to bounce back a little more.",55,55
36,en_participant_0036,Q11,Human Interviewer Advantage,Medium,neutral,"For AI, the human being would tend to bounce back more easily to try to guide me. So, I am a little more lost in fact in my answer, and I tend to ask myself the question: is it the right answer?",55,55
