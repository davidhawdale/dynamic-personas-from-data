FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q4,Ecological Conviction Limits AI,High,negative,"So, for personal tasks, I really try to limit my use of AI, because out of ecological conviction I really want to restrict it to professional-level tasks.",16,16
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q4,Energy Consumption Awareness,High,negative,"I'm aware and informed that using generative AI, for example to do a search, consumes a lot more energy, water and electricity than doing a search on Google.",20,20
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q4,Holiday Planning Avoidance,Medium,negative,"I've heard a lot of people say they talk with ChatGPT to organize their vacations, like having a detailed itinerary when you go somewhere. For example, I know it could save me time, but again, for the reasons I mentioned, I prefer not to do it.",24,24
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q5,Mobile Access Gap,Medium,neutral,"since I haven't downloaded ChatGPT or another AI app on my phone, my use is really limited to when I'm at home in front of my computer.",29,29
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q5,Travel No Real Friction,Low,positive,I haven't had a situation where I needed it to an excessive degree. I always manage to do things as before and find an alternative solution to meet my needs.,33,33
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q8,Professional Assistant Preference,High,positive,"I'm really more interested in a personal assistant in a professional context. As I said, not for personal use, but for professional use. Ideally for me it would even be to have several assistants, each with a specific specialty, who could help me in my freelance activity on a daily basis.",47,47
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q8,Admin Assistant Invoice Task,High,positive,"an assistant who would handle all the administrative side, the paperwork, sending invoices",47,47
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q8,Content Strategy LinkedIn Assistant,High,positive,"an assistant who would help me with content strategy, helping me write content, notably on LinkedIn",47,47
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q8,Sales Outreach Assistant,High,positive,an assistant who would have more of a sales hat and would help me with outreach and prospecting potential clients.,47,47

FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q8,Invoice Follow-up Administration,Medium,neutral,"That assistant would be more in a context where I have a lot of invoices to send. It would really help me with sending invoices, follow-ups if invoices aren't paid on time, and all the administrative part related to services, with all the tasks to manage.",55,55
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q9,Email Sequence Automation Need,High,positive,"So maybe it could help me create email sequences more easily, instead of managing all that manually today.

FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q9,Limited Tool Integration,Medium,neutral,"I don't use any today, so in any case on the email automation part, I don't have tools that allow me to do that. Hence the interest maybe of being helped by AI on that part.",64,64
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q11,Written Format Preference,High,positive,"the fact that the questions are written, ultimately, I find that less disruptive than the tool tested just before where it's really a conversation.

FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q11,Voice Interaction Skepticism,Medium,negative,"I'm a bit more skeptical when the AI takes the form of voice notes versus the written side. I think we shouldn't forget that we're addressing a machine, and for those reasons, I find it more fluid for me to interact this way.",78,78
FR1,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0001,Q11,Machine Identity Clarity Important,High,positive,"the fact that exchanges go through writing—sure, it's less human—but in any case, it doesn't make the person in front think they're interacting with a real human. It really puts back the place it actually has, I find.",82,82
