9,en_participant_0009,Q1,AI Tool Selection,Low,neutral,ChatGPT,3,3
9,en_participant_0009,Q2,Usage Frequency,Low,neutral,Weekly,7,7
9,en_participant_0009,Q4,Search Enhancement Preference,High,positive,I'd say I use AI most often for searching things and finding quick answers. I really like how nuanced you can get with your searches instead of just typing keywords and then searching and going through all the different results that come up.,16,16
9,en_participant_0009,Q4,Visual Cooking Assistance,High,positive,"The other thing I use it for a lot is cooking, like asking, ""What temperature do I need to have this?"" and being able to physically show, ""Is this brown enough yet?"" or things like that.",16,16
9,en_participant_0009,Q4,Travel Research Use Case,Medium,positive,"I also use it, for example, when planning a trip to research things in the area that I might not have known about before, and to understand things that you just need to physically be there to grasp or read through a lot of reviews to comprehend.",24,24
9,en_participant_0009,Q5,Context Overhead Avoidance,High,negative,"Sometimes I don't use it because I can tell that I'm going to have to give it a lot more context than I could just do in my brain. Like, I'll think it's faster for me to just write out this message or give advice for this thing because I just know more about it.",29,29
9,en_participant_0009,Q5,Interpersonal Context Gap,Medium,negative,"a lot of times there are different people involved, and I know who to go to, who's the right person for what, whereas chat or any other kind of AI might not know that.",29,29
9,en_participant_0009,Q5,Personal Context Preservation,High,negative,"Sometimes when I'm writing a message for someone I know and I want to add context about our relationship or an inside joke that we might share, I find that if I use AI for those kinds of contexts, I often say to leave space for me to add personal anecdotes. It's just too much to think about what personal anecdote I'm going to include, and then I worry about it being misconstrued.",33,33
9,en_participant_0009,Q6,High Trust in AI Results,Medium,positive,4 - High trust,38,38
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Desire for Agent Capabilities,High,mixed,"I think that I would definitely need it to have more agent-like qualities than AI currently has. I know that some of the AI companies have things like ChatGPT has an operator feature. However, it's quite buggy, and you still really need to watch it. You can't really trust it to just go out and do things for you.",47,47
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Proactive Assistant Preference,High,positive,"But I think something that just lets me use it less would be ideal, like it just knows my routines and stuff like that. I don't need to think about, ""Oh, I'm going to go and use it."" It already kind of knows when it's needed and when it can chime in and say, ""Hey, I can do this for you quicker,"" or whatever it might be.",49,49
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Device Reduction Goal,Medium,positive,"I also want to use it to help me get off of other devices as much as possible. Instead of spending a bunch of time researching things for a vacation or something like that, I want to be able to say, ""Hey, I'm booking a vacation for..."" and so far, AI tools are pretty good at that.",51,51
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Contextual Memory Gap,High,negative,"Maybe just knowing a lot more about me and what I prefer as a person would be helpful. I know that memory has been getting a lot better with AI tools, but we're definitely not at the point yet where it knows enough context about you and what you prefer and holds the really important memories to make that work.",51,51
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Contextual Message Suggestions,Medium,positive,"Yeah, so if I'm about to write a message back to someone, maybe when I get into the text bubble itself, it could have a couple of options already based on the context of the entire conversation I've had with this person. That could be a good example of when it might know when to chime in.",55,55
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Intelligent Booking Assistance,Medium,positive,"Or let's say I'm booking concert tickets and I'm trying to figure out which seat is the best one. Instead of having to download a PDF and then put it in there or say, ""I'm going to the Chase Center,"" and giving all that context to a chatbot, it could ask me questions as I'm going through the booking process.",55,55
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Writing Style Preservation,High,negative,"I think AI knowing my writing style would be great. The number of times I've tried to get AI tools to stop using the em dash is countless, and it never works every time I say not to use it. People don't use that; most people don't even know what keys to press to get to it.",59,59
9,en_participant_0009,Q8,Personalized Travel Preferences,Medium,positive,"Also, I would love it to know my preferences, like what I prefer when I'm on vacation. For example, am I traveling alone or with someone else? If I have a partner, it should know to book a hotel that can fit two people versus one. Or maybe it knows that I prefer showers over baths, so it ensures that the place has a nice shower instead of just a bathtub.",61,61
9,en_participant_0009,Q9,Calendar Integration Desire,High,positive,"Oh, yeah. Of course. I would love for AI to be connected with my calendar and email. It would enable me to do a whole lot more.",66,66
9,en_participant_0009,Q9,Autonomous Event Coordination,High,positive,"Just the idea that if I'm texting someone in my family and they're like, ""Oh, we haven't hung out in a bit. Let's hang out. Let's do something in the city,"" it could then suggest, ""Oh, you want to do something in the city on Saturday? Let's find something."" Then it could book me, let's say, going to see a museum. It would book the tickets for that and create a Google Calendar event for myself or whoever is involved. Bam, plans made, versus having to coordinate, ""Alright, what do we want to do? Okay, maybe we want to go to a museum. Which museum do we want to go to? Are they open during that time? Alright, this is the museum we're going to. This is the time."" Then we'll both separately add it to whatever our preferred calendar method is.",66,66
9,en_participant_0009,Q11,Voice AI Interface Anxiety,High,negative,"At first, I was like, really? Camera and audio? I feel like a lot of times I don't use AI tools with the camera or audio. I get nervous about it. It almost feels like phone call anxiety, like when you need to call someone. It's like when you're a little kid and, for the first time, you have to call the dentist to make an appointment. For some reason, AI feels like that to me when I'm doing it through video or call.",76,76
9,en_participant_0009,Q11,In-Depth Question Value,High,positive,"But at the same time, it was actually pretty nice to have these in-depth questions and know that you're not, for example, to get these kinds of in-depth questions, you'd either need to be on a call with a person or physically in front of someone. So you'd need to schedule a time that both of you are available, and I also felt that it added very in-depth follow-up questions that a person physically just wouldn't have enough time to think about between my answer and the next question. So it was actually a lot more pleasant than I was imagining it to be.",76,76
9,en_participant_0009,Q11,Text Composition Advantage,Medium,positive,"I guess with text, you're able to type everything you want to say and look it over to ensure that you're sending the right message and getting the prompt exactly right, as opposed to including all the ""ands"" and ""ums"" of a regular conversation.",80,80
9,en_participant_0009,Q11,Voice Interruption Frustration,Medium,negative,"I also don't like how many AI services, when you're using voice mode, will respond as soon as you stop talking for half a second, even if you still have more to say.",80,80
9,en_participant_0009,Q11,Voice Plus Text Format Preference,High,positive,"I also liked that I was able to answer in voice to really get my thoughts out quickly and in the way that I'm naturally used to. However, I appreciated that it responds to me through text. For instance, this question here is in text instead of a voice coming back at me, which allows me to look at it and see the entire question. Sometimes there might be a two-part question, and I might forget the second part.",84,84
