42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Organization Focus,High,positive,"I use AI a lot for mostly for organizational purposes. So when I use it for any of my personal task, it might be for, you know, trying to maybe put together, like, a meal plan for myself or if I want to try to start out like a new workout regimen or anything like that, I'll use AI to kind of help organize what, Monday through Friday schedule could look like for the type of workouts that I'll do",16,16
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Message Conciseness,High,positive,"The other thing that I use AI, mostly for in my personal, for any personal tasks is, really just kind of either consolidating, like, my thoughts or my messages that I might send out to someone else, either through LinkedIn, connecting with people, sending out emails, whatever the case may be. It's really good for just, you know, making my messages, my sentences, whatever I may be putting together in a more concise manner.",16,16
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Writing Struggle,Medium,neutral,I feel like that's like a problem that I kind of struggle with at times,16,16
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Discovery Through Social,Medium,neutral,"Honestly, in the beginning, it was just kind of for experimentation purposes. I had seen, I think, probably either some YouTube or TikTok videos talking about how other people had used AI to set out their daily routines or workout routines, or whatever the case may be.",20,20
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Personalized Guidance,High,positive,"I just gave it an understanding of my height, weight, and goals—what I was trying to accomplish. I also wanted to make sure that I was eating this, that, and the third. Based on the information I provided, I asked if it could give me a workout plan for the week and everything like that.",20,20
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Resume Optimization,High,positive,"the probably the biggest use case for how I used AI for, like, kind of either consolidating my thoughts or messages was when I was in the period of looking for a job. So naturally, as I was looking for a new job, that was the time for me to kind of update my resume. ... AI was really helpful in that sense of really consolidating a lot of the bullet points",24,24
42,en_participant_0042,Q4,Maintain Meaning,Medium,neutral,"a lot of the prompts that I was asking was to maintain the same, meaning, but kind of shorten this particular bullet point, to make it a bit more concise. Again, while, while still maintaining its, same meaning that I want to convey",24,24
42,en_participant_0042,Q5,Image Generation Failure,High,negative,"I had used and I had prompted ChatGPT to generate an image for me, and I tried to give it a bunch of information, a bunch of context to it. And it either took too long or I had to re prompt it a few, different times for it to work. And then even then, it wasn't the exact image that I had in mind.",29,29
42,en_participant_0042,Q5,Technical Stalling,Medium,negative,"The AI-generated image had some issues that I ran into, such as ChatGPT stalling out, for lack of a better word, when I submitted the prompt for the image request.",33,33
42,en_participant_0042,Q5,Manual Workaround,Medium,positive,"Ultimately, the alternative I ended up going with was making the image myself through Canva. I was really trying to create a particular graphic that I wanted to print out. I tried AI for the first go but didn't really like how it looked.",33,33
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Source Citation Gap,High,negative,"I think one of the most important things I would want it to do is, you know, usually I'm using AI for either doing very quick research on particular topics or asking good questions on maybe topics that I'm not really too familiar with ... what would be perfect for that AI tool would be if it automatically cited its sources and provided at least a little bit of an explanation for why it pieced together these insights based on the sources it collected.",47,47
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Paywall Opacity,High,negative,"sometimes the source it might be referring to is blocked by a paywall. So if it is, I'm wondering if it's pulling the information based on either just the headline or the first couple of sentences behind the paywall, or in some way, is the AI able to bypass the paywall and give me the information from the blocked content that I can't see?",47,47
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Memory Persistence Need,High,negative,"So the other thing that I would like from, I guess, the perfect AI assistant would be if, you know, when I submit a couple of prompts, the AI tool responds back. And then usually after that, there's a little bit of a follow-up prompt or a follow-up message or description showing that the memory has been updated from that particular AI tool so we can reference our previous conversations and what we've discussed.",51,51
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Proactive AI Anticipation,High,negative,what would be awesome to see is if AI would be a little bit more proactive or forward-thinking based on the previous conversations that I've had with it.,53,53
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Contextual Reminder Value,High,positive,"For example, if I made a prompt saying, ""Hey, I would like to set this routine for myself for the next month,"" and then we lay out a schedule of what I want to do, how I want to do it, and things of that nature. Then maybe a couple of weeks later, if I were discussing a separate topic with the AI tool, it would give me an answer to that request or prompt that I submitted.",55,55
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Progress Check-in,High,positive,"It would also have a follow-up question like, ""Hey, Noah, I know that we talked about this a couple of weeks ago. How has your progress been on this? Do you need any help maybe reconfiguring your routine? Do you need to make any adjustments based on any results you've seen?""",57,57
42,en_participant_0042,Q8,Proactive Without Prompting,High,positive,"Usually, I haven't seen that yet from any AI tools. It would be really nice to have that, kind of like a little reminder feature, so to say, without me having to prompt it. I think something like that would really boost the AI tool's capabilities in my mind.",59,59
42,en_participant_0042,Q9,Privacy Data Concern,Medium,negative,"I think an AI being interconnected with my calendar, email, and other systems or tools could be potentially a really cool thing. I sometimes wonder about privacy issues and data concerns with some of those integrations.",68,68
42,en_participant_0042,Q9,Smart Task Prioritization,High,positive,"if I'm thinking about an AI tool as a personal assistant, it would be nice to have it better prioritize certain tasks based on synthesizing information. For example, it could see that I have a doctor's appointment coming up next week and that I also need to study for an exam. It could prompt me by saying, ""Hey, Noah, you have a busy week coming up. You should prepare for it by doing X, Y, Z,""",68,68
42,en_participant_0042,Q11,AI Interview Effectiveness,High,positive,"In certain aspects, it was better than I had thought, especially with some of the follow-up questions that seemed to be prompted based on what I had said in the previous question.",78,78
42,en_participant_0042,Q11,Human Interview Skepticism,High,negative,"I admittedly had some reservations about how that would go because I feel like that's one of the integral parts of being interviewed by a human—being able to pick up on certain details that you might add in, along with certain facial expressions or maybe certain tones, and how that can be leveraged to ask a follow-up question and dive deeper into a particular topic or statement.",78,78
42,en_participant_0042,Q11,Auditory Preference,High,negative,"It was different from being interviewed by a human, just not being able to hear or see the human itself. ... I think what helps me and makes me feel more comfortable in a lot of these interactions is being able to hear that voice, having that auditory conversation back and forth.",78,78
42,en_participant_0042,Q11,Facial Emotion Detection,High,positive,"If it could pick up on cues like, okay, this person seems frustrated, annoyed, happy, sad, whatever, while talking about this topic, then it could follow up with, ""I noticed that you seem frustrated while discussing this. Why are you frustrated? What is causing this frustration?"" Things like that. I think that could be really impactful going forward.",82,82
