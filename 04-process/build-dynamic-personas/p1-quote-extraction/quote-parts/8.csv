8,en_participant_0008,Q4,Accidental AI Discovery,Medium,neutral,"I use AI unintentionally all the time when I'm just Googling things, and the AI summary appears at the top.",16,16
8,en_participant_0008,Q4,Hobby Identification Tools,Medium,positive,"There are AI tools for photo identification or sound identification ... It's a hobby, and it makes life more interesting when I can identify the birds around me.",16,20
8,en_participant_0008,Q4,Travel Translation Utility,Low,positive,"when I've traveled to other countries where I don't speak the language, AI translation has helped with communication.",16,16
8,en_participant_0008,Q4,Obsolescence Fear Motivator,High,negative,What motivates me to build these apps is the fear of being left behind by technology and becoming obsolete.,24,24
8,en_participant_0008,Q4,AI Capability Paradox,High,mixed,I also find it fascinating to work with an AI assistant that is incredibly good at some things and incredibly bad at others ... they also make baffling decisions that a human probably would not make.,24,24
8,en_participant_0008,Q5,UX Heuristic Analysis Gap,Medium,neutral,"I've wished I could use AI to do things like, run a heuristic analysis on a design I make to tell me where, where I might be making mistakes or where there are where there's room for improvement.",29,29
8,en_participant_0008,Q5,Static Image Limitation,Medium,negative,"The AI agent just doesn't have access to the prototype, and it can't navigate around it ... I haven't been successful in the past in getting it to actually interact with an interactive prototype that I've created.",33,33
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Hallucination Distrust,High,negative,"The most important thing, if I were to need one, would be for it to not hallucinate, for me to be secure that the information it was providing is true and not hallucinations or lies.",47,47
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Confident Misinformation Risk,High,negative,"Often, when interacting with these AI entities, they present information in a very confident and convincing way, even when it's completely wrong.",47,47
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Quality Over Speed,High,negative,"So far, I would say they're not making things faster in a way that's usable ... They can do things faster, but not at the level of quality I need. So overall, it's not faster; it just can't get done correctly.",47,47
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Design System Constraint Failure,Medium,negative,"it will be wrong in all sorts of wacky ways. It combines different UI elements together in ways that don't make sense. Its color values are either way off or slightly off, and the layout is just different.",51,51
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Process Value Over Output,High,negative,"a big part of the value I get from those things is the act of engaging with the material directly, understanding how it's laid out and how it's presented ... It's not just the answer; it's not just the information at the end. It's the whole process of engaging with it, thinking about it, and turning things over in my mind.",55,55
8,en_participant_0008,Q8,Critical Thinking Erosion Concern,High,negative,"I worry that AI assistants will skip this process and interfere with people's ability to think critically, synthesize information, and come up with their own ideas.",55,55
8,en_participant_0008,Q9,Automation Capability Exists,Low,neutral,"it could schedule things for me based on an email I receive. It can update a schedule based on something happening, like if I have an appointment somewhere and then they decide to close that day, it can reschedule for me.",60,60
8,en_participant_0008,Q9,Direct Control Preference,High,negative,I don't really want it to do any of those things. I prefer to make those decisions directly. I don't trust an AI assistant enough to know what my choice would be in all those situations.,60,60
8,en_participant_0008,Q11,Verbal Comfort Gap,Medium,negative,I think it would have felt more natural if the questions were asked verbally or if there was an audio component.,70,70
8,en_participant_0008,Q11,Mechanical Interaction Difference,Medium,neutral,"This feels more mechanical, not necessarily in a bad way, but it just doesn't feel like a similar type of interaction to me.",74,74
8,en_participant_0008,Q12,Mechanical Tone Response Mirror,Medium,negative,"I think I mirror back the sense of it being mechanical in the way I respond. There's a lack of warmth and a lack of connection, and I believe that affects how I choose to engage.",78,78
