FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q4,Precision And Tone Refinement,Medium,positive,"For rephrasing exchanges with a real estate agency, the AI helped me add precision to my sentences and adopt a slightly more formal and cordial style.",20,20
FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q5,Secure Environment Access Barriers,High,negative,"Using AI in a professional context — now we have a tool managed by the data team, but given the secure environment I work in, at the bank level, it was very complicated to use, for example, ChatGPT.",29,29
FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q8,Context Precision Recognition,High,neutral,"the most important thing a personal assistant can do is understand my request with very precise context, so that it can help me effectively while allowing me to make my personal adjustments as little as possible.",47,47
FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q8,Data Integration For Analysis,High,neutral,"what would interest me is that it's directly connected, at least in my professional case, directly to our data and brings more precision.

FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q9,Automated Meeting Summaries,High,mixed,"On Google Meet, for example, it would allow me — although it already exists, but in our company it's impossible — to generate automatic meeting summaries, which takes a lot of time and would allow for more precision regarding the minutes.",64,64
FR36,en_translated_from_fr_participant_0036,Q11,Context Loss With AI Interviewer,High,negative,"there's less context, less opportunity to explain why I'm doing this interview and to ask other questions and to follow up a bit more.",74,74
