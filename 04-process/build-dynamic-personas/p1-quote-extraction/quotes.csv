1,en_participant_0001,Q4,Ecological AI Restriction,High,negative,"for personal tasks, I really try to limit my use of AI, because for ecological reasons, I really want to restrict it to professional tasks. Even at a professional level, I always try to think if I can do it another way. So, for personal tasks, my use is very, very limited, if not nonexistent.",12,12
1,en_participant_0001,Q4,AI Energy Cost Awareness,High,negative,"using generative AI, for example, to do a search, consumes much more energy, water, and electricity than doing a search on Google. It's really something I'm aware of, and it's for these reasons that I really try to limit my use of AI to the bare minimum.",15,15
1,en_participant_0001,Q4,Ecological Avoidance Vacation,Medium,mixed,"I know it could save me time, but again, for the reasons I mentioned, I prefer not to do it.",18,18
1,en_participant_0001,Q5,Mobile AI Access Gap,Medium,neutral,"since I haven't downloaded ChatGPT or another AI application on my phone, my use is really limited to when I'm at home in front of my computer. So, all the situations where I could potentially use it on the go, but in any case, since I don't have the application, I don't do it.",22,22
1,en_participant_0001,Q5,Self-Sufficient Alternative Finding,Medium,neutral,I always have a solution. I haven't had a situation where I needed it excessively. I always manage to do as before and find an alternative solution to meet my needs.,25,25
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,Specialised Professional Assistants,High,positive,"Ideally, I would even have several assistants, each with a specific specialty, who could help me in my freelance activity on a daily basis. For example, an assistant who would manage all the administrative part, paperwork, sending invoices, an assistant who would help me with everything related to content strategy, helping me write content, especially on LinkedIn, and then an assistant who would have more of a sales role and would help me with all the prospecting and potential client outreach.",35,35
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,LinkedIn Content Creation Need,Medium,positive,"The content strategy assistant would actually help me with everything related to content creation, so mainly for me on LinkedIn, to help me write quality posts without it taking too much time.",38,38
1,en_participant_0001,Q8,Invoice Admin Automation,Medium,positive,"This assistant would be more in a context where I have a lot of invoices to send. It would really help me with sending invoices, follow-ups if invoices are not paid on time, and all the administrative part related to services, with all the tasks to manage.",41,41
1,en_participant_0001,Q9,Email Sequence Automation Interest,Medium,positive,"maybe it could help me create email sequences more easily, instead of managing all that manually today. There would certainly be things that could be automated without needing, for example, to subscribe to a tool for all this CRM email sending part.",45,45
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,Written Format Preference,Medium,positive,"the fact that the questions are written, in the end, I find it less disturbing than the tool tested just before where it is really a conversation. I am more comfortable with the fact that here, the questions and follow-ups are done in writing.",55,55
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,AI Voice Skepticism,High,mixed,"I'm a bit more skeptical when AI takes the form of voice notes versus the written side. I think it's important to remember that we're talking to a machine, and for those reasons, I find it more fluid for me to interact this way.",58,58
1,en_participant_0001,Q11,Machine Transparency Preference,High,neutral,"the fact that exchanges are written, certainly, it's less human, but at least, there you go, it doesn't make the person in front maybe believe that they are interacting with a real human being. It really puts it in its rightful place, I think.",61,61
2,en_participant_0002,Q4,AI As Excel Shortcut,High,positive,"I use AI to streamline the process of analyzing that data, such as aggregates, projections, and pivot tables. AI serves as a shortcut to remembering how to do things in Excel with the data. I just tell the AI what my end goal is and let it figure out the menus and icons needed to get there.",20,20

2,en_participant_0002,Q5,Self-Censorship Over Privacy,High,negative,"Not so much couldn't, I'm probably more under the realm of shouldn't. I'm thinking about some privacy concerns. What is it that I want to put into, you know, do I particularly want to train somebody else's model, and what happens to that data after the fact? So, again, I haven't encountered something that I wasn't able to do, more that I chose not to do.",29,29
2,en_participant_0002,Q5,PII Sharing Concern,High,negative,"Any PII? Anything concerning other people? Yeah, essentially. Once it gets out into the open, where is it going? What's actually happening to that data?",33,33
2,en_participant_0002,Q8,Voice Input Preference,High,mixed,"a better solution would be to verbally describe and have the tool accept all the nuances of, you know, a bit of a rambling answer, much like this perhaps, with some ums and ahs, as opposed to a perfectly formatted piece of input.",47,47
2,en_participant_0002,Q8,Personalised Response Style,High,neutral,"customized responses, which may already be available, but phrased and communicated in a way that matches how I best absorb information. What I mean by that is, you know, direct answers sometimes, as opposed to long, meandering responses. So, learning or being told how I would want to receive that information, just not what the information would be.",51,51
2,en_participant_0002,Q8,Multi-Platform Availability,Medium,neutral,"being available on multiple platforms seems like a fairly basic requirement—desktop, mobile, you know, near-instantaneous responses and high availability.",55,55
2,en_participant_0002,Q9,Autonomous Async AI Appeal,High,positive,"can I ask you to send an email at some point in the future? Or, you know, other things that aren't synchronous but are asynchronous activities?",60,60
2,en_participant_0002,Q9,Periodic Background Monitoring,Medium,positive,"if I wanted to book a flight, let's say, to London, to check the flights now and also periodically look up the prices of flights every five days for the next couple of weeks and let me know when the prices change.",64,64
2,en_participant_0002,Q11,AI Interview Felt Natural,Medium,positive,"it certainly wasn't, yeah, it felt as natural as doing it with a person.",74,74
2,en_participant_0002,Q11,Correcting AI Misinterpretation,Low,neutral,"Oh, I actually said it was as natural. So that was a misinterpretation. I thought it was as natural as talking to a person.",78,78

3,en_participant_0003,Q4,Curiosity Driven Exploration,Medium,positive,"I had heard a friend used AI for recipe ideas, so I just typed in toddler-friendly meals because I'm a mom. I haven't tried it for adult meals yet, but I am intrigued by the idea.",20,20

3,en_participant_0003,Q5,Moderation Surprise Acceptance,Medium,mixed,"I was actually kind of pleased that it rejected my photo because it was one that I hadn't considered inappropriate. It was a picture of my daughter using the potty, which I thought would be fun to turn into a coloring page, but it never occurred to me that it was inappropriate.",29,29
3,en_participant_0003,Q8,Old School Cautious User,High,negative,"I am a little old school and a bit nervous about using AI exclusively. I always like to double-check that it's accurate, both in work and outside of work.",43,43

3,en_participant_0003,Q8,Satisfied With Current Scope,Medium,neutral,"It can't drive a car, it can't take care of my child, and it can't buy groceries for me. So I think right now, I'm just enjoying its current capabilities.",47,47
3,en_participant_0003,Q9,Human Approval Before Action,High,neutral,"I would be worried about errors, so I would want to double-check things. I would prefer to approve items before they automatically go to email or send a calendar invite.",56,56
3,en_participant_0003,Q9,AI Integration Efficiency Value,Medium,positive,"AI is also interconnected with some of the tools that I use for work, like video editing and transcription, which I love.",56,56
3,en_participant_0003,Q11,Dynamic Personalisation Delight,High,positive,I really liked how the AI was dynamic and how it provided customized questions based on my previous responses. That was pretty cool.,66,66
3,en_participant_0003,Q11,Repetition Frustration Stakes,High,negative,"I think I was just kind of frustrated because I didn't have a good answer, and I would have liked it if it was a human who could have pivoted and maybe asked something else. So, it felt a little bit limiting, but I don't think the stakes were very high here, so it didn't matter ... It could be a bigger issue if I was interviewing for a job or in a work meeting with a client.",70,70
3,en_participant_0003,Q11,Indirect Question Preference,Medium,neutral,"a better question would have been, ""What are some tasks that are really time-consuming and arduous in your life today?"" Something less direct and more indirect.",74,74
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Practical Everyday AI Use,Medium,neutral,"I usually use it more to ask for recipes or look up a term I don't know, search for a product that I know might be sold on Amazon in another country, but not in Argentina.",12,12
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Knitting Pattern AI Failure,High,negative,"Once I asked for a knitting pattern, I like to knit and crochet, and I asked it to help me create a sweater pattern. It didn't work very well, but it was useful to get ideas on what colors I could combine.",12,12
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Color Matching Success,Medium,positive,"it did work well when I asked it to help me choose colors, to see which color matched with which or what colors from a pattern in a photo I had seen on Pinterest, where I could get similar colors that were all from the same yarn, let's say, the same brand and the same thickness.",15,15
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Yarn Quantity Miscalculation,High,negative,I asked it to help me calculate the amount of yarn I would need for a medium-sized sweater and it calculated too much yarn ... I ended up with double the yarn I needed.,15,15
5,en_participant_0005,Q4,Content Creation Scaffolding,Medium,positive,"I used it to ask if there was any YouTuber in Argentina doing the same thing as me ... it did give me ideas on how I could structure a video if I decide to do it at some point, with a kind of script and ideas on what I can talk about.",18,18
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Broken Product Links,High,negative,"sometimes it doesn't work for me when I want to search or find a product to buy in Argentina. Many times it gives me links that lead nowhere or are not of the product I'm looking for, not even related.",22,22
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Wrong Yarn Substitute,High,negative,"the substitutes it gave me did not correspond to the thickness of yarn I needed to replace. For that reason, I feel it didn't work for me.",25,25
5,en_participant_0005,Q5,Ignored User Clarification,High,negative,"I had clarified that please give me links to products that I could buy and it kept sending me the same links, so I feel it didn't work because of that.",25,25
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Proactive Prompt Improvement,High,mixed,"It would be nice if it could help me improve prompts without me having to ask. For example, if I'm in situations where I get frustrated because I ask for something and it doesn't deliver, it could help me understand how I should ask for it, so I also learn how to ask for things in the future. That's something I feel they don't do today.",35,35
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Preference Memory Desire,High,negative,"being able to solve things already knowing, without me having to explain every time what I want in repetitive tasks. For example, when translating something, that it already remembers that I speak Spanish and that I usually need translations into English.",37,37
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Travel Planning Unrealism,High,mixed,"it was a bit unrealistic in terms of the time we had and the things to visit. For example, in one day it expected us to go to six places, but the reality is that, being there, between the fatigue accumulating and there being many things to see, maybe you want to see something and stay a while watching it and not just see it and go to the next attraction.",39,39
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Availability Aware Suggestions,High,negative,"I would also have liked that, when we asked for ticket prices or hotel suggestions, it sent options with availability for those dates, because the suggestions it had were not available for the dates we had already given.",42,42
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Travel Agent Analogy,Medium,neutral,"I feel it would have been good if it acted a bit like a travel agent. I'm not asking it to book the tickets or pay for them for me, just to give concrete options that are available and that the itinerary makes sense.",42,42
5,en_participant_0005,Q8,Persistent Context Per Chat,High,mixed,"I think I would just like to be able to save, maybe, like prompts or have a chat for this and not forget what that chat is for. For example, a chat for translations, but never forget that it always has to translate from Spanish to English. A chat where I put ingredients and it gives me recipes, and I don't have to remind it why I'm giving it ingredients and what I need it to return.",45,45
5,en_participant_0005,Q9,Email Summarization Integration,Medium,positive,"regarding emails, it could be useful to summarize some if they are long or pre-filter things by grouping emails of the same type.",49,49
5,en_participant_0005,Q9,Photo Location Memory,Medium,positive,"when you take a photo, that it adds information, not just a description of an image, but maybe it would be good that, for example, if I was traveling, it tells me where I was, so I don't forget what building I saw, since after a while you might forget.",49,49
5,en_participant_0005,Q9,Event Preparation Reminders,Medium,positive,"if my event is a medical exam, that before going, a few hours before or a day before, that can be customizable, it reminds me and gives me tips to go prepared. For example, remember to bring the latest medical studies.",49,49
5,en_participant_0005,Q11,Language Comfort Advantage,Medium,positive,"I can choose in which language I feel more comfortable speaking, and that's much better. That's an advantage I see.",56,56
5,en_participant_0005,Q11,Less Nervous With AI,High,mixed,"it worries me a little less because there is no one watching me and I feel less evaluated. In my personal case, I think it refers to that. But I miss a bit the warmth of talking to a person, being able to make a joke that they laugh, being able to see a little the face of the interviewer, which here I don't see.",59,59
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,AI As Pre-Filter,High,positive,It acts as a pre-filter before I reach out to the vet.,16,16
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Speed Over Search,High,positive,"ChatGPT is likely to give me an answer that's at least 80% accurate, compared to Googling, which results in a bunch of website links that I then have to sift through to find the answer. So, it's quicker if I just ask.",16,16
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Iterative Narrowing Dialogue,High,neutral,"I do a sequence of conversations, so I don't just ask one question and then get the answer. I normally start with a question that gives a general idea of what's happening, and then I receive an answer. After that, I narrow it down further, and it provides me with another answer, which I narrow down even more.",20,20
6,en_participant_0006,Q4,Sponsored Content Distrust,Medium,negative,looking at recommendations online is very difficult because there's a lot of paid sponsorship that is disguised as articles. It's hard to know for sure if something was not sponsored to give a good review versus a genuine review.,24,24
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Prompt Labor Cost,High,negative,The level of specificity I needed to provide was more work for me than if I just did the animations myself. The amount of labor it would have taken to work through the AI to get it to function and produce what I wanted was just too much.,29,29
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Creative Vision Gap,High,negative,"it's very difficult to get the image that you actually have in your head for the judge for any AI to reproduce. That is actually very hard. They might create something you really like or something that's somewhat within the frame of what you're thinking, but it's not going to recreate what you actually were thinking of.",33,33
6,en_participant_0006,Q5,Nuance Complexity Barrier,High,negative,"you have to create a prompt that indicates and defines all those nuances in a syntax that's understandable by the AI so that it can at least provide you with a result that's within the ballpark of what you want. The more nuances there are, the more likely it is that you'll miss it, either because it's just not intelligent enough or your prompt was not good enough.",35,35
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Accuracy Primary Requirement,High,negative,"accurate information will always be the most important factor ... the most difficult aspect of AI assistance right now is that they are not accurate, and there's also no way to know which parts are not accurate, especially if you're not an expert in the field that we're discussing.",49,49
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Source Mismatch Frustration,High,negative,"if I'm asking for a tutorial on how to use a relatively new tool in Figma, it might give me an answer that sounds like it's about that tool. However, when I check the source, it's actually a tutorial for a similar but different tool. I then have to spend time reading through that to realize, oh, this is not accurate; it's just assuming that this one tool can be used the same way as the other one.",53,53
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Cross-Conversation Memory Gap,High,negative,"it would be better if the AI had a stronger memory of the conversations it has with users. Within a single chat, it remembers the conversation quite well, but it still misses some parts or gets confused. It doesn't really transfer information from other conversations effectively.",57,57
6,en_participant_0006,Q8,Cross-Reference Desired,Medium,mixed,It would be helpful if it could remember when I talked about something in another chat and cross-reference those discussions. I believe that would enhance the experience significantly.,57,57
6,en_participant_0006,Q9,Integration Value Skepticism,High,mixed,the question for me is whether it really shortens the time I spend on these tools. Is it really improving them?,62,62
6,en_participant_0006,Q9,AI As Shortcuts Only,High,neutral,"how I see AI being integrated into tools is more like shortcuts. It can add shortcuts to things, but it can't really provide full-fledged functionality, basically.",62,62
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Survey Not Interview,High,negative,"It feels more like a survey, like a form survey with video recording in it, rather than an actual interview.",72,72
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Generic Follow-Up Feeling,Medium,negative,"The way this has been structured feels very generic and general. It does refer back to something you said earlier, but not in a specific niche way.",76,76
6,en_participant_0006,Q11,Deviation Value Recognition,Medium,mixed,"In human interviews, you can go off the path, which can be both good and bad. Sometimes, it is in those deviations that you find interesting pieces of information.",76,76
