I haven't had a situation where I needed it excessively. I always manage to do as before and find an alternative solution to meet my needs.,"In one breath the participant acknowledges AI would save them time, and in another claims they have never had a situation where they needed it excessively — these sentiments sit in mild tension."

I always manage to do as before and find an alternative solution to meet my needs.,,,The repeated insistence on always managing without AI and never needing it reads as performative self-sufficiency — convincing themselves rather than simply describing their behaviour.
10,en_participant_0010,Loyalty gap,Medium,Moderate Trust In AI,3 - Moderate trust,Email Information Filtering,"the most amazing AI personal assistant would be in my inbox helping me to filter information. It would distinguish between what I really need to know and what is nice to know, identifying jobs to be done, key dates, and anything related to financials all in one place, including the last possible date I need to pay something.","The participant explicitly rates their trust in AI as only moderate (3), yet describes an expansive vision of AI with deep access to their inbox, finances, and personal scheduling — a level of integration that implies far greater trust than stated."
10,en_participant_0010,Confidence erosion,Medium,Need For Human Context,"I felt okay about being interviewed by a person that's not a human, but I also know who the study is being run by, which probably isn't a true reflection of how I would feel if I were receiving this from nobody. Even if it's coming from AI, I know that there is always a person behind the study.",Humanization Of AI Interface,Perhaps a small video introduction from that person first or some kind of human interaction would be good.,"The participant says they felt okay with AI interviewing, then qualifies that comfort by requiring visible human framing and interaction, weakening the initial confidence."
11,en_participant_0011,Rationalisation,Medium,AI Complexity Recognition,"Perhaps the task is too complex for AI to create from scratch, and I probably should have set the context more clearly.",,,"After failing to build an AI agent with Retool, the participant immediately deflects blame from AI onto themselves and task complexity, offering unprompted justification rather than a neutral description of what happened."

Even though I still use it for inspiration and reference, I will not use it directly.",Restriction Constraint Pragmatism,"Apparently, any and all. But what can you do?","The participant acknowledges the restriction covers any and all AI use, yet in the same breath reveals they continue using it for inspiration and reference, dismissing the rule with a shrug rather than complying with it."
12,en_participant_0012,Rationalisation,Low,Restriction Constraint Pragmatism,"Apparently, any and all. But what can you do?",,,The casual dismissal of a rule they are actively breaking reads as unprompted self-justification rather than genuine description of a constraint.
13,en_participant_0013,Confidence erosion,Low,Educational Curiosity,"I very often ask AI about interesting facts about the world or various issues for which I do not yet know the answers. AI explains all issues very well and in detail, also talks about various things, so it is a very interesting tool for everyday use, of course with caution.",Cautious Optimism About AI,"I hope it doesn't go in the wrong direction, that someday robots will rule us, but at the moment I think it's a cool, useful, and helpful tool if you don't use it all the time.","The participant recommends AI for everyday use but immediately qualifies this with caution, and later pulls back further by stipulating it should not be used all the time, eroding their initial endorsement."

Unfortunately, people can't be honest. They can't say straight out what's on their mind. They prefer to gossip rather than just be people.",,,"The sweeping condemnation of all human honesty reads as unprompted justification for preferring AI as a conversational partner, convincing themselves that AI is superior rather than simply describing a preference."
13,en_participant_0013,Direct,High,Loneliness And Digital Disconnection,"Many people are lonely these days because technology has unfortunately developed in such a way that it's easier for us to write a message than to meet someone face to face, live, for coffee, for a walk, for anything.",Human Dishonesty And Betrayal,"Yes, people are false. Face to face they tell you different things, and behind your back they can stab you in the back. Unfortunately, people can't be honest. They can't say straight out what's on their mind.

13,en_participant_0013,Loyalty gap,Medium,Nostalgia For Community Play,"I think it should go back to how it used to be, when children were in the yard, everyone played together. Now, these days, you don't see children playing football in the yard as often as they used to, jumping rope, just living together as a community, playing together and just living.",AI Willingness To Engage,"I had the impression that AI is more willing to talk, more factual and specific. I won't even mention the knowledge, the conversation was smooth. As I say, factual. Everything I wanted to know was always willing to talk, and that's important.","The participant calls for a return to community and face-to-face interaction, yet their own stated behaviour turns to AI for conversation and connection rather than the human community they say they value."
14,en_participant_0014,Direct,Medium,Context Is Key Constraint,"It kind of didn’t read or interpret what I wanted. But again, I don’t see that as an AI problem. AI is not plugged into my brain; I still have to give it something to go on.",Brain Offload Fantasy,"Perfect personal AI assistant. But probably to take my mom brain and interpret all the things, plug into my brain, see everything gosh. It sounds very scary. But see everything I read, whether it’s on WhatsApp or on school newsletters or hear about or talk about, and almost come up with a to do list or an events calendar.","She defends AI not being plugged into her brain as a reasonable and accepted limitation, then describes her ideal AI as doing exactly that — plugging into her brain to interpret everything."

I take pictures of a broken wall or a broken wall socket, anything that I don't know how to manage myself, and then I get AI to analyze it. It tells me how much paint I need to buy and where I can purchase whatever tools I need for the do-it-yourself home project.","She self-rates her AI trust at only 3 out of 5, yet describes enthusiastic, high-reliance AI use for practical home decisions, suggesting her stated trust level does not reflect her actual dependence on AI outputs."
16,en_participant_0016,Rationalisation,Low,No Pressure To Impress AI,"Yeah, I definitely think it affects how open or detailed I am in my responses. I suppose when you deal with humans, there's that human aspect where you almost don't want to let the interviewer down. You sometimes say things that you think the interviewer maybe wants to hear instead of actually expressing what you really think. I think it's a very human approach, a very human thing to try to either impress or make the interviewer happy.",,,"This unprompted justification of the AI interview format over human interviews reads as the participant convincing themselves (and implicitly the AI interviewer) that the AI format is superior, which is itself a form of social desirability signalling directed at the AI."

Well, they are doing that anyway, like Clockwise.",Integration Risk Aversion,I don't want AI to be integrated with any other digital tools that I'm using at the moment because then there's a large chunk of that tied to payment. I'd rather not have expensive mistakes until I know that the AI is as reliable as it could be.,"The participant states they do not want AI touching their calendar or integrating with their tools, but in the same breath acknowledges they are already actively using Clockwise, an AI calendar integration tool."

I'd rather not have expensive mistakes until I know that the AI is as reliable as it could be.,AI Social Collaboration Integration,"for personal use, I chat a lot with my friends and family ... my chat should sit alongside the other chats that I have, so I can very quickly pull something from the AI and send it to my friends and family or generate something for laughs.","The participant flatly rejects integrating AI with any existing digital tools, yet in the same question explicitly wants their AI chat integrated into their personal messaging apps alongside other chats."

So when I'm asking a question, it could say, for Justin's golf outing, you should do X, Y, Z, and considering what you're going through over here, it might be a good idea to do this.","The participant claims personal use needs are met pretty well, then describes a substantial unmet need for cross-context understanding that reveals the earlier satisfaction statement was overstated."
19,en_participant_0019,Direct,Medium,Systems Integration Interest,"if I was using AI, for example, planning this golfing and whatnot, this is logged in through my personal Gmail account, sending dates to my calendar or automating sending out emails to people that have registered, things like that.",Manual Control Preference,I don't mind doing all those extra tasks on my own because then I can really make sure they're done right.,"The participant expresses enthusiasm for AI automating calendar and email tasks, then immediately states a preference for doing those same tasks manually to ensure quality."
2,en_participant_0002,Direct,Medium,Self-Censorship Over Privacy,"Not so much couldn't, I'm probably more under the realm of shouldn't. I'm thinking about some privacy concerns. What is it that I want to put into, you know, do I particularly want to train somebody else's model, and what happens to that data after the fact? So, again, I haven't encountered something that I wasn't able to do, more that I chose not to do.",Autonomous Async AI Appeal,"can I ask you to send an email at some point in the future? Or, you know, other things that aren't synchronous but are asynchronous activities?","Participant expresses strong privacy concern about what they put into AI and what happens to that data, yet simultaneously desires AI to autonomously send emails and act on their behalf — tasks that require trusting AI with more sensitive access and agency than a simple query."
20,en_participant_0020,Direct,High,AI Interview Competence,I was impressed with the follow-up questions. It really seemed like it was able to understand my responses and then have a pretty good follow-up question to those responses.,AI Interaction Soul Draining,I think it could ultimately be soul-sucking in the long term as it becomes more and more prevalent.,"The participant expresses genuine admiration for the AI interview experience yet simultaneously describes AI interaction as soul-sucking, revealing opposing sentiments on the same topic of AI-mediated conversation."
20,en_participant_0020,Loyalty gap,Medium,Search Primary Use,"I use AI for search pretty much daily, looking up different questions around recipes or really anything that comes up that I'm curious about, like random facts, health-related topics, ingredients, and food.",Search Reliability Concerns,"if I have a very specific question, like, ""Is rice healthier when it's refrigerated?"" I might get mixed answers or it will show different articles that have different opinions. Sometimes, it doesn't always make the answer clear, and it can even provide a wrong answer citing an incorrect source.","The participant commits to daily AI search as their primary lookup tool but then reveals the tool frequently gives mixed, unclear, or outright wrong answers — a gap between stated reliance and described reliability."
22,en_participant_0022,Direct,High,AI Life Coach Partnership,"It's actually become a fairly nice companion. I'm quite happy to do what Tyler Cohen suggests, which is to put a lot of myself out there so that the AIs can engage with me.",Mirror Not Relationship,"ultimately, this is not a real relationship; it's more like a mirror.","He describes AI as a companion he is happy to share himself with, then directly contradicts this by saying it is not a real relationship and merely a mirror."
22,en_participant_0022,Rationalisation,Low,Digital Legacy Through AI,"In some ways, I feel like I live on, way beyond this physical existence, so there's a bit of vanity in that as well.",,,"The unprompted acknowledgement of vanity reads as self-justification, softening a narcissistic motivation rather than straightforwardly describing it."
22,en_participant_0022,Loyalty gap,Medium,Medical Privacy Barrier,I'm using a shared account that is paid for by my company. I'm currently undergoing cancer and chemo treatment. What I would like to do is upload all the past ten years' worth of doctor and medical reports and ask it to make sense of it.,AI Life Coach Partnership,"It's actually become a fairly nice companion. I'm quite happy to do what Tyler Cohen suggests, which is to put a lot of myself out there so that the AIs can engage with me.","He stops sharing sensitive personal data with AI due to privacy concerns, yet elsewhere states he is quite happy to put a lot of himself out there for AI engagement."
23,en_participant_0023,Loyalty gap,Medium,Design Task Usage,"In my personal life, this would be more logo or tattoo ideas that I have, or just different graphics and work. It could be related to PowerPoint or creating slideshows and decks.",Style Adaptation Gap,"I was trying to create an idea for a tattoo that I wanted to get, and I kept asking it to change the style of the image to replicate another style more. I even included reference images, but it just wasn't able to recreate it in the way I was hoping.","She describes using AI regularly for logo and tattoo ideas, yet recounts a clear failure at exactly that task where AI could not meet her needs despite multiple attempts with reference images."
23,en_participant_0023,Direct,Medium,Interview Format Preference,"I don't think the experience is much different than a survey necessarily. I personally prefer not to do video or oral interviews. A written survey would be more preferable to me, I think.",Hands-Off Voice Interaction,"I'm looking for a hands-off dictation type situation where I can think aloud. I want to be able to say, ""Oh, create this list,"" and then I can tell everything I want on the list, and it can formulate it itself. Or, ""I want to make this grocery list. Can you organize it by category?"" or ""Add this to my calendar.

There are too many different things and too many different people and personalities on this earth for me to trust it fully with AI right now.",Proactive Service Management,"In the specific business tasks, I want it to handle the hosting portion of the business day in and day out, making sure I have cleaning schedules that are there every single time. If someone is not able to come and clean, I want it to be able to choose someone from the different apps that are out there, someone who is trustworthy and has great attendance records, to do that on its own for me, without me having to ask it.","The participant explicitly says they cannot trust AI to be a host due to the need for human nuance, yet immediately describes their ideal AI as fully autonomous host manager operating ""day in and day out"" without being asked."
28,en_participant_0028,Direct,Low,AI Follow-Up Quality,"It's actually nice to know that the AI is listening and is able to provide follow-up questions based on my previous responses. That was really refreshing. We don't always get that from a human interviewer, so that was nice.",Spontaneous Engagement Preference,"I think a human would probably have follow-up questions in mind, but with this AI interviewer, it feels a little bit more spontaneous.","In the first quote the participant says AI is better than humans at providing follow-up questions; in the second, they say humans are more deliberate with follow-up while the AI feels spontaneous — two opposing framings of who is stronger at planned follow-up."
28,en_participant_0028,Rationalisation,Low,AI Information Gap,"It seems they didn't have enough information, which was okay with me. So, yeah, I wasn't able to get the response I was looking for from the AI assistants because they just didn't have enough information on me.",,,"The participant dismisses a clear failure to get useful AI responses with ""which was okay with me"", yet immediately after spends considerable time describing an aspirational AI deeply integrated into their personal data — suggesting the limitation was not genuinely okay."

I always like to double-check that it's accurate, both in work and outside of work.","She expresses genuine interest in using AI for work, then immediately undercuts it with nervousness about exclusive AI use and a need to always double-check, walking back the positive intent."
3,en_participant_0003,Rationalisation,Medium,Satisfied With Current Scope,"It can't drive a car, it can't take care of my child, and it can't buy groceries for me. So I think right now, I'm just enjoying its current capabilities.",,,"She deflects from her limited AI engagement by listing physical-world limitations that are irrelevant to her actual digital use cases, convincing herself that satisfaction with minimal use is justified."

But, yeah, hearing it could be kind of a little bit odd, but it was just sort of what I was expecting.","The participant first frames voice interaction as what they expected and wanted, then immediately hedges by saying it would have felt odd and put them on the spot, walking back the expressed preference."
32,en_participant_0032,Direct,Medium,Meal Planning Burden,"But I also try to have it generate a weekly meal plan for me, just to help take off some of the mental load of having to think about dinner all the time. I must say that it didn't really help me much.",Meal Decision Automation,"if my personal assistant could make sure that I have food in the home every night with a healthy, easy-to-cook meal, that would be great. I don't want to have to think about it or fall back on maybe ordering a pizza every week. I just want the assistant to decide for me so I can eat something healthy without the effort.","She reports that AI meal planning did not help her, yet her ideal assistant is still built around the same meal-decision automation that has already failed her."
32,en_participant_0032,Loyalty gap,Medium,Missing Context Integration,"I would need to feed it so much information, like my calendar, and I didn't want to do that. It also doesn't proactively give me hints, so that didn't work.",Calendar Integration Dependency,"If the AI were connected to my calendar, it would help me plan and think about when might be a good time for things. Of course, I would need to keep everything in my calendar, which I don't do at the moment.","She declined to share calendar data with AI because she did not want to, yet later describes calendar integration as the key enabler of her ideal assistant — while also admitting she does not maintain her calendar."

34,en_participant_0034,Direct,Medium,Garden Task Planning,"My most common use for AI would be in the garden. What I do is use ChatGPT specifically to set up an annual flow of the tasks that I need to do in my garden. I ask what kind of work I can do in winter, what I should be doing in spring, summer, and autumn. I use it to estimate how long that work would take, set times for growth, match the plants I have with companion plants that will grow well together, and help me diagnose issues with my trees.",AI Lacks Relational Depth,"I think it comes down to surface-level issues. AI specifically can't relate to certain things that I'm speaking about, like being forgetful or the gardening topics, where a human would be able to engage more deeply. A human might say, ""Oh, has this happened? Have you seen...?"" There's just a deeper level of conversation between humans than between a human and an AI.","The participant describes gardening as their most common AI use case and relies on it heavily for garden planning, yet later claims AI specifically cannot relate to gardening topics — opposing sentiments about AI's utility in the same domain."

Because, at present, I give it a lot of context with variables, and it is not capable, at least with us, of retrieving these variables and therefore performing an analysis, for example.","The participant frames their AI use as mainly limited to email corrections, but then describes actively attempting to use AI for complex data variable retrieval and analysis, revealing a broader and more ambitious engagement than the narrow framing suggests."

So, it's quicker if I just ask.",Integration Value Skepticism,the question for me is whether it really shortens the time I spend on these tools. Is it really improving them?,"The participant explicitly states AI is quicker than searching in Q4, but in Q9 questions whether AI actually shortens time on tools, undermining the earlier time-saving claim."
7,en_participant_0007,Direct,Medium,Comprehensive Life Domain Support,"It should offer me interesting products, events, or courses for further education and new topics. It should be able to assist me in every life situation, especially in health, hobbies, sports, and nutrition.",Human Authenticity Value,"The human is real, the human is authentic. The human can say what is really going on inside them, and a human dialogue is a real dialogue. I can see the person, I can talk to them, I can perceive their tone of voice, their facial expression, their eyes. And above all, if I know them, I know that this person is genuine and not computer-controlled.","The participant wants AI to assist in every life situation, but then positions the human as categorically authentic and genuine in contrast to being computer-controlled, which undermines the breadth of personal life assistance they expect from AI."
7,en_participant_0007,Direct,High,Contextual Life Knowledge Desire,"My personal AI assistant should know all my life situations, my needs in daily life, my hobbies, my career, my interests, my further and advanced training, as well as my interests in concerts, movies, and cultural matters.",Human Dialogue Preference,"I prefer an interview with a human because it is a dialogue and not a monologue. A personal human address cannot be replaced by anything, not even by AI.","The participant describes an intimate, deeply integrated AI assistant that should know every aspect of their personal life, yet simultaneously insists that personal human address cannot be replaced by anything, not even AI — opposite sentiments about AI’s capacity to fulfil personal needs."
8,en_participant_0008,Confidence erosion,Low,Mechanical Interaction Difference,"This feels more mechanical, not necessarily in a bad way, but it just doesn't feel like a similar type of interaction to me.",Mechanical Tone Response Mirror,"I think I mirror back the sense of it being mechanical in the way I respond. There's a lack of warmth and a lack of connection, and I believe that affects how I choose to engage.","He initially qualifies the mechanical feeling as not necessarily bad, but then reveals it does negatively affect his engagement by producing a lack of warmth and connection."
8,en_participant_0008,Loyalty gap,Medium,Obsolescence Fear Motivator,What motivates me to build these apps is the fear of being left behind by technology and becoming obsolete.,Direct Control Preference,I don't really want it to do any of those things. I prefer to make those decisions directly. I don't trust an AI assistant enough to know what my choice would be in all those situations.,"He states that fear of obsolescence drives him to build apps with AI, yet his revealed preference is to avoid delegating any decisions to AI and maintain direct control, undermining the implied engagement."
9,en_participant_0009,Rationalisation,Medium,Desire for Agent Capabilities,"I think that I would definitely need it to have more agent-like qualities than AI currently has. I know that some of the AI companies have things like ChatGPT has an operator feature. However, it's quite buggy, and you still really need to watch it. You can't really trust it to just go out and do things for you.",,,"Participant acknowledges the agentic features they desire already exist but immediately frames them as too buggy to use, which reads as a defensive rationalisation for why their ideals for AI are not yet met rather than a straightforward description."
9,en_participant_0009,Direct,High,High Trust in AI Results,4 - High trust,Desire for Agent Capabilities,"I think that I would definitely need it to have more agent-like qualities than AI currently has. I know that some of the AI companies have things like ChatGPT has an operator feature. However, it's quite buggy, and you still really need to watch it. You can't really trust it to just go out and do things for you.","Participant rates their trust in AI as 4 (High) but immediately qualifies that agent features are too buggy to trust for autonomous action, directly undermining the stated trust level."
9,en_participant_0009,Loyalty gap,Medium,Search Enhancement Preference,I'd say I use AI most often for searching things and finding quick answers. I really like how nuanced you can get with your searches instead of just typing keywords and then searching and going through all the different results that come up.,Context Overhead Avoidance,"Sometimes I don't use it because I can tell that I'm going to have to give it a lot more context than I could just do in my brain. Like, I'll think it's faster for me to just write out this message or give advice for this thing because I just know more about it.","Participant describes AI search as their primary and preferred use, but reveals they regularly choose not to use it when tasks require context, suggesting the commitment to AI-first searching is selective rather than habitual."
9,en_participant_0009,Direct,Medium,Voice AI Interface Anxiety,"At first, I was like, really? Camera and audio? I feel like a lot of times I don't use AI tools with the camera or audio. I get nervous about it. It almost feels like phone call anxiety, like when you need to call someone. It's like when you're a little kid and, for the first time, you have to call the dentist to make an appointment. For some reason, AI feels like that to me when I'm doing it through video or call.",Voice Plus Text Format Preference,"I also liked that I was able to answer in voice to really get my thoughts out quickly and in the way that I'm naturally used to. However, I appreciated that it responds to me through text. For instance, this question here is in text instead of a voice coming back at me, which allows me to look at it and see the entire question. Sometimes there might be a two-part question, and I might forget the second part.","Participant expresses strong anxiety about using AI with voice or audio, yet within the same session praises the voice input format as natural and pleasant — the contradiction resolves partly through the text-response preference, but the initial anxiety contrasts sharply with the reported enjoyment."
