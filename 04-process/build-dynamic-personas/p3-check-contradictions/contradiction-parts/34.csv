I ask what kind of work I can do in winter, what I should be doing in spring, summer, and autumn. I use it to estimate how long that work would take, set times for growth, match the plants I have with companion plants that will grow well together, and help me diagnose issues with my trees.",AI Lacks Relational Depth,"I think it comes down to surface-level issues. AI specifically can't relate to certain things that I'm speaking about, like being forgetful or the gardening topics, where a human would be able to engage more deeply.
