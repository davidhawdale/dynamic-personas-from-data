44,en_participant_0044,Direct,Medium,Human Interview Preference,"Being interviewed by an AI is different in that, I think with a human, there’s more relationship, more reciprocity, and more of a conversation. There’s a greater back and forth. With an AI, there’s none of that, so it relies on me to carry the conversation.",AI Dynamic Follow-Up Value,"the AI was able to pick up on things that I had said and ask a follow-up question about that with a specific follow-up rather than just a generic ""tell me more about why you gave the answer you did"" type of question.","The participant first claims AI provides no back-and-forth and relies on them to carry the conversation, then contradicts this by crediting the AI for picking up on their answers and asking specific follow-up questions."
