9,en_participant_0009,Direct,High,High Trust in AI Results,4 - High trust,Desire for Agent Capabilities,"I think that I would definitely need it to have more agent-like qualities than AI currently has. I know that some of the AI companies have things like ChatGPT has an operator feature. However, it's quite buggy, and you still really need to watch it. You can't really trust it to just go out and do things for you.","Participant rates their trust in AI as 4 (High) but immediately qualifies that agent features are too buggy to trust for autonomous action, directly undermining the stated trust level."
9,en_participant_0009,Loyalty gap,Medium,Search Enhancement Preference,I'd say I use AI most often for searching things and finding quick answers. I really like how nuanced you can get with your searches instead of just typing keywords and then searching and going through all the different results that come up.,Context Overhead Avoidance,"Sometimes I don't use it because I can tell that I'm going to have to give it a lot more context than I could just do in my brain. Like, I'll think it's faster for me to just write out this message or give advice for this thing because I just know more about it.","Participant describes AI search as their primary and preferred use, but reveals they regularly choose not to use it when tasks require context, suggesting the commitment to AI-first searching is selective rather than habitual."
9,en_participant_0009,Direct,Medium,Voice AI Interface Anxiety,"At first, I was like, really? Camera and audio? I feel like a lot of times I don't use AI tools with the camera or audio. I get nervous about it. It almost feels like phone call anxiety, like when you need to call someone. It's like when you're a little kid and, for the first time, you have to call the dentist to make an appointment. For some reason, AI feels like that to me when I'm doing it through video or call.",Voice Plus Text Format Preference,"I also liked that I was able to answer in voice to really get my thoughts out quickly and in the way that I'm naturally used to. However, I appreciated that it responds to me through text. For instance, this question here is in text instead of a voice coming back at me, which allows me to look at it and see the entire question. Sometimes there might be a two-part question, and I might forget the second part.","Participant expresses strong anxiety about using AI with voice or audio, yet within the same session praises the voice input format as natural and pleasant — the contradiction resolves partly through the text-response preference, but the initial anxiety contrasts sharply with the reported enjoyment."
9,en_participant_0009,Rationalisation,Medium,Desire for Agent Capabilities,"I think that I would definitely need it to have more agent-like qualities than AI currently has. I know that some of the AI companies have things like ChatGPT has an operator feature. However, it's quite buggy, and you still really need to watch it. You can't really trust it to just go out and do things for you.",,,"Participant acknowledges the agentic features they desire already exist but immediately frames them as too buggy to use, which reads as a defensive rationalisation for why their ideals for AI are not yet met rather than a straightforward description."
