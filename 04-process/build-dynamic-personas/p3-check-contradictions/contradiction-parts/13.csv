13,en_participant_0013,Direct,High,Loneliness And Digital Disconnection,"Many people are lonely these days because technology has unfortunately developed in such a way that it's easier for us to write a message than to meet someone face to face, live, for coffee, for a walk, for anything.",Human Dishonesty And Betrayal,"Yes, people are false. Face to face they tell you different things, and behind your back they can stab you in the back. Unfortunately, people can't be honest. They can't say straight out what's on their mind. They prefer to gossip rather than just be people.","The participant blames technology for destroying face-to-face human connection, yet in the same interview actively dismisses human interaction as dishonest and untrustworthy, undermining the premise that real-world connection is worth preserving."
13,en_participant_0013,Loyalty gap,Medium,Nostalgia For Community Play,"I think it should go back to how it used to be, when children were in the yard, everyone played together. Now, these days, you don't see children playing football in the yard as often as they used to, jumping rope, just living together as a community, playing together and just living.",AI Willingness To Engage,"I had the impression that AI is more willing to talk, more factual and specific. I won't even mention the knowledge, the conversation was smooth. As I say, factual. Everything I wanted to know was always willing to talk, and that's important.","The participant calls for a return to community and face-to-face interaction, yet their own stated behaviour turns to AI for conversation and connection rather than the human community they say they value."
13,en_participant_0013,Rationalisation,Medium,Human Dishonesty And Betrayal,"Yes, people are false. Face to face they tell you different things, and behind your back they can stab you in the back. Unfortunately, people can't be honest. They can't say straight out what's on their mind. They prefer to gossip rather than just be people.",,,"The sweeping condemnation of all human honesty reads as unprompted justification for preferring AI as a conversational partner, convincing themselves that AI is superior rather than simply describing a preference."
13,en_participant_0013,Confidence erosion,Low,Educational Curiosity,"I very often ask AI about interesting facts about the world or various issues for which I do not yet know the answers. AI explains all issues very well and in detail, also talks about various things, so it is a very interesting tool for everyday use, of course with caution.",Cautious Optimism About AI,"I hope it doesn't go in the wrong direction, that someday robots will rule us, but at the moment I think it's a cool, useful, and helpful tool if you don't use it all the time.","The participant recommends AI for everyday use but immediately qualifies this with caution, and later pulls back further by stipulating it should not be used all the time, eroding their initial endorsement."
