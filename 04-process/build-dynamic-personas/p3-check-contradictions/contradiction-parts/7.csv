The human can say what is really going on inside them, and a human dialogue is a real dialogue. I can see the person, I can talk to them, I can perceive their tone of voice, their facial expression, their eyes. And above all, if I know them, I know that this person is genuine and not computer-controlled.","The participant wants AI to assist in every life situation, but then positions the human as categorically authentic and genuine in contrast to being computer-controlled, which undermines the breadth of personal life assistance they expect from AI."
