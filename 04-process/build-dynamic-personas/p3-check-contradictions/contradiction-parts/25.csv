25,en_participant_0025,Direct,High,Human Touch Trust Barrier,"I wanted to ask AI to be a host for the business, but I believe you need to have a human touch sometimes for that. There are too many different things and too many different people and personalities on this earth for me to trust it fully with AI right now.",Proactive Service Management,"In the specific business tasks, I want it to handle the hosting portion of the business day in and day out, making sure I have cleaning schedules that are there every single time. If someone is not able to come and clean, I want it to be able to choose someone from the different apps that are out there, someone who is trustworthy and has great attendance records, to do that on its own for me, without me having to ask it.","The participant explicitly says they cannot trust AI to be a host due to the need for human nuance, yet immediately describes their ideal AI as fully autonomous host manager operating ""day in and day out"" without being asked."
