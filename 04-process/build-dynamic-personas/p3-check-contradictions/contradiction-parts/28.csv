So, yeah, I wasn't able to get the response I was looking for from the AI assistants because they just didn't have enough information on me.",,,"The participant dismisses a clear failure to get useful AI responses with ""which was okay with me"", yet immediately after spends considerable time describing an aspirational AI deeply integrated into their personal data — suggesting the limitation was not genuinely okay."
