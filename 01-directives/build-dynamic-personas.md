# Directive: Build Dynamic Personas

## Goal

Distil 52 research interview transcripts into five Dynamic Personas that teams can converse with via an AI interface to explore and pressure-test a Personal AI Assistant application.

## Context

> From `00-brief/product-vision.md`: An AI assistant that people choose to use daily for their personal needs — not because they have to, but because it consistently delivers value, earns their trust, and fits seamlessly into their lives.

The transcripts contain rich qualitative insight that is currently static and requires manual synthesis. This directive transforms that insight into interactive, character-based representations grounded explicitly in transcript evidence.

## Inputs

| Input | Location |
|-------|----------|
| 52 interview transcripts | `03-inputs/transcripts/` |
| Research brief | `03-inputs/research-brief.md` (or equivalent) |

## Outputs

| Output | Location |
|--------|----------|
| 5 Dynamic Persona profiles | `05-outputs/personas/` |
| Traceability matrix | `05-outputs/traceability-matrix.md` |
| Usage guidance | `05-outputs/usage-guidance.md` |

## Workflow

`02-workflows/build-dynamic-personas/`

## Success Criteria

- Teams can use personas to pressure-test ideas in early discovery
- Persona attributes are traceable to transcript evidence
- Conversations feel realistic, coherent, and differentiated across personas
- Personas surface reactions, objections, and needs in response to product concepts
