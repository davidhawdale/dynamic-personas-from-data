# Research Brief: Personal AI Assistant Discovery

## 1. Background

You want to design the "go to" and most used and most trusted personal assistant for consumers and get VCs to fund your new venture.

To do so, you and your team need to know when people use AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini in their personal life, when they don't, and why.

This research will inform the product vision and positioning for a new personal AI assistant—one designed to become an essential daily tool that people trust, rely on, and genuinely want to engage with.

**Product Vision:** Build an AI assistant that people choose to use daily for their personal needs—not because they have to, but because it consistently delivers value, earns their trust, and fits seamlessly into their lives.

**Business Goal:** Develop a compelling product story backed by user insights to secure Series A funding from top-tier venture capital firms.

**Unique Aspect:** These interviews were conducted entirely by an AI interviewer, which serves both as a methodological experiment and a meta-insight into AI interaction preferences. This approach:

- Tests whether users are comfortable providing personal insights to an AI
- Surfaces trust and comfort levels with AI in research contexts
- Provides data on AI-conducted research as a potential product feature

---

## Research Methodology

**Format:** Semi-structured interviews (60 minutes each)

**Sample size:** 15-20 participants

**Analysis approach:** Thematic analysis focused on:

- Behavioral patterns (when, how, why AI is used)
- Unmet needs and pain points
- Trust factors and barriers
- Opportunity spaces for innovation

**Deliverables:**

- Thematic analysis report with supporting quotes
- Opportunity map for product innovation
- User archetypes or segments

## Success Criteria

This research is successful if it enables us to:

1. **Identify 3-5 high-potential opportunity areas** where existing AI tools consistently fail to meet user needs
2. **Define what "trustworthy" means** in concrete, actionable terms for our target users
3. **Understand the competitive positioning** that would make our assistant the clear choice over existing tools
4. **Articulate a compelling user-centered narrative** for our product vision and VC pitch

**Key question this research must answer:** What would make someone choose OUR AI assistant as their primary personal AI tool, over ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, or any other option?
