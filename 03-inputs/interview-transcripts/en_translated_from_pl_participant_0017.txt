*Q4*
MODERATOR: What are the most common personal tasks you use AI for? Tell me about a few examples.

PARTICIPANT: I use AI for things that allow me to gather information or get information about what I can visit in a given country.

MODERATOR: You mentioned travel planning. How exactly do you use AI to gather information about places to visit?

PARTICIPANT: I plan what I can visit on a given day in a country so I don't have to travel from one end of the city to the other.

MODERATOR: How does AI help you optimize those sightseeing routes? What specific information do you get from it?

PARTICIPANT: It's best to get around a city using the metro, public transport like trams, buses, or trains. I wonder whether I'll be able to visit two tourist attractions in one day.

*Q5*
MODERATOR: Tell me about a situation when you wanted to use AI but couldn't. What was the task? What prevented you from using AI?

*Q8*
MODERATOR: Imagine you have an ideal personal AI assistant. What are the most important things it should do for you? How would it be better than current tools?

PARTICIPANT: It would be best if it showed verified information, not fake, Linux.

MODERATOR: I understand you want certainty about the credibility of information. What other features would be important to you in an ideal AI assistant?

PARTICIPANT: That in the future it could help with everyday life, but not replace face-to-face contact.

MODERATOR: How exactly do you envision that help in daily life? What tasks would it perform?

PARTICIPANT: I'm not an expert, and whether for this particular illness I need to go to a specialist immediately or can I wait for an appointment?

*Q9*
MODERATOR: How could such an AI assistant be connected to other systems you use (e.g., calendar, email, etc.)? What would that enable you to do?

PARTICIPANT: With a calendar it could remind me of things I've saved there.

MODERATOR: Besides the calendar, what other systems would you like to connect the AI assistant to?

PARTICIPANT: Maybe some home appliances.

MODERATOR: Which specific home appliances would you like to connect to the AI assistant and what would it do with them?

*Q10*
MODERATOR: Before we finish, I'd like to hear your impressions of talking with AI...

PARTICIPANT: Continue

*Q11*
MODERATOR: How did you feel answering questions from AI instead of a person? How did this experience differ from talking to a person?

PARTICIPANT: AI still can't fully express itself correctly in a given language, so I preferred to communicate with a person in that regard.

MODERATOR: Could you explain in more detail what makes you prefer talking to a human? What specific language problems did you notice in the conversation with AI?

PARTICIPANT: Grammar problems, and artificial intelligence cannot replace face-to-face conversations.

MODERATOR: You mentioned that face-to-face conversations are irreplaceable. What specifically do you miss in interaction with AI?

PARTICIPANT: In contrast, when I speak face to face, I can see how the person reacts to the questions, how they answer, what their facial expressions are.
