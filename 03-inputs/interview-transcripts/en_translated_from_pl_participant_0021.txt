*Q8*
MODERATOR: Imagine you have an ideal personal AI assistant. What are the most important things it should do for you? How would it be better than current tools?

PARTICIPANT: An ideal AI assistant should not only be able to answer a question, but also find, for example, video materials that answer such a question or give concrete solutions for a given problem.

MODERATOR: You mentioned video materials. What other forms of help or resources should an ideal AI assistant offer?

PARTICIPANT: It should be able to point to specific products or materials whose quality is confirmed by users.

PARTICIPANT: Continue

*Q11*
MODERATOR: How did you feel answering questions from AI instead of a human? How did this experience differ from talking to a person?

PARTICIPANT: For now it's hard to get used to that kind of conversation, because it's not the same interaction as talking to a human, if only because you don't see the other side's reactions.

MODERATOR: You mentioned the lack of reaction from the other side. How does that affect your honesty and openness in your answers?

PARTICIPANT: The lack of reaction doesn't affect openness or honesty in the answers; it just requires getting used to the fact that there is no immediate reaction on the other side, for example facial expressions.

*Q12*
