# Project Brief: Dynamic Personas from Data

## Goal

Translate existing research interview transcripts into **five Dynamic Personas** that the team can actively engage with to discuss a **Personal AI Assistant application** , enabling richer, faster discovery conversations.

## Background

We have a body of qualitative research captured in interview transcripts. While these transcripts contain valuable insight, they are currently static and require manual synthesis.

The opportunity is to:

* Distil research into actionable, character-based representations.
* Make insights interactive rather than document-bound.
* Enable teams to “talk to the research” during exploration and ideation.

## Inputs

- 52 interview transcripts and the research brief that led to the interviews
- Any available market data that provides insight

## Outputs

Five Dynamic Personas that:

* Are grounded explicitly in transcript evidence.
* Reflect distinct behavioural patterns, motivations, and tensions.
* Can be queried conversationally via an AI interface.
* Surface likely reactions, objections, and needs in response to product concepts.

Each persona should include:

* **Core behavioural traits**
* **Goals & motivations**
* **Pain points & friction patterns**
* **Decision drivers**
* **Context of use**
* **Evidence anchors** (linked back to transcript excerpts)
* **Inferred but directional backstory** (clearly marked as synthetic)

## Dynamic Capability Requirements

The personas must:

* Respond in-character.
* Reference research-grounded reasoning where possible.
* Distinguish between:
  * Transcript-supported evidence
  * Pattern-based inference
* Surface uncertainty when data is weak.
* Maintain internal behavioural consistency across conversations.

## Success Criteria

* Teams can use the AI Assistant to pressure-test ideas in early discovery.
* Personas provide insight that aligns with transcript themes.
* Stakeholders trust the grounding and traceability.
* Conversations feel realistic, coherent, and differentiated across personas.
* The tool accelerates synthesis compared to manual document review.

## Deliverables

* 5 fully defined Dynamic Persona profiles.
* Traceability matrix mapping persona attributes to transcript evidence.
* Usage guidance for product, design, and research teams.

## Expected Impact

* Faster ideation cycles.
* Shared understanding of user archetypes.
* Reduced reliance on manual synthesis.
* More consistent research-informed decision-making.
* Scalable access to qualitative insight.
