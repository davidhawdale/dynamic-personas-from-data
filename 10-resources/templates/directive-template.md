# {Directive Name}

## Goal

{One or two sentences: what this workflow produces and why it matters. Reference source documents if relevant (e.g., the strategic research brief).}

## Context

{Background the orchestrator needs to understand the task. What project is this part of? What data is being worked with? What are the key concepts or categories? Keep it concise — enough to orient, not a full briefing.}

## Strategic Success Criteria

{How this workflow's output serves the project's overarching goals. Pulled from the project brief (`00-brief/`). Helps the orchestrator and sub-agents frame findings toward what ultimately matters.}

## Inputs

{What the user provides or what gets passed in when the workflow runs. List each input with a brief description.}

## Acceptance Criteria

{Numbered list of conditions that must all be met for the output to be considered complete. These should be specific enough to validate against — the orchestration file will use them for quality checks.}

## Workflow

See `02-workflows/{name}/` for the detailed process.
